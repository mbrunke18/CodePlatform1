Understood. If you're focusing on a pre-selected customer or an internal team and don't need self-service sign-up, we can adapt the plan to a "white-glove" onboarding model.
This approach focuses the test entirely on the core product experience.
Here is the revised UAT plan.
## Revised UAT Plan: White-Glove Onboarding
✅ Stage 1: Manual Customer Provisioning (Your Team's Task)
Instead of the customer signing up, your team will set up their environment manually.
 * Create the Organization: An engineer on your team directly inserts a new record for the customer into the organizations table in the production database.
 * Provision User Accounts: Manually create accounts for each of the customer's testers in the users table, ensuring they are all correctly linked to the new organizationId.
 * Securely Share Credentials: Share the initial login credentials with each tester through a secure method (like a password manager or a one-time secret sharing link).
 * First Login Confirmation: The customer's first task is simple: log in successfully and confirm they see their company's dashboard, ready for use. This validates that the manual setup was successful.
✅ Stage 2: Core Workflow Simulation (Customer's Task)
This stage is the most critical and remains the same. The customer team will run a complete, real-time decision-making process.
Scenario: A "Sudden Supply Chain Disruption."
Execution Steps:
 * Initiate the "War Room": The customer's team lead starts the scenario from the appropriate template.
 * Test Real-time Collaboration: All customer testers join the session. They must confirm that updates made by one user are seen instantly by all other participants, validating the real-time experience.
 * Validate AI-Powered Insight: A user must ask the AI Co-pilot a relevant question based on their company's (pre-loaded or historical) data, like: "What were the lessons learned from our last product recall?" The team validates if the answer is relevant, accurate, and valuable.
 * Confirm Decision Logging: The team makes a formal decision within the platform. Your technical lead immediately queries the decisionOutcomes table in the database to confirm the record was created correctly and is tied to the right organization.
✅ Stage 3: Value & Outcome Validation (Joint Task)
This stage confirms the platform delivered the expected value.
 * Test Automated Reporting: The customer tests the "Board-Ready Reporting" feature to ensure it generates a useful, accurate summary of their simulation.
 * Verify the Learning Loop: Your team confirms that the outcomes of the simulation have correctly updated the institutionalMemory, making the platform smarter for the customer's next session.
 * Conduct Qualitative Debrief: Hold a feedback session with the customer testers, asking key questions:
   * "Did this process feel significantly more efficient than your current method?"
   * "Was the AI's insight something that would have been difficult to find on your own?"
   * "Did the platform help you feel more confident in your final decision?"
This revised approach bypasses the commercial aspects and focuses squarely on validating the core product experience and its ability to deliver tangible value.

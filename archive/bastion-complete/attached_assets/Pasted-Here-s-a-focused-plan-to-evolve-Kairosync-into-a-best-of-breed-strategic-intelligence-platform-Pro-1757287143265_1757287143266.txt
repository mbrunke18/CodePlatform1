Here’s a focused plan to evolve Kairosync into a best‑of‑breed strategic intelligence platform.

Product foundation and data model
Multi-tenant + RBAC: Org → Business unit → Team scoping; roles (exec, strategy lead, analyst, owner) with granular permissions.
Canonical entities: StrategicScenario, Risk, Initiative, KPI, Insight, Recommendation, ActionItem, Evidence, DataSource.
Relationships: Scenario ↔ AIAnalysis ↔ Insight ↔ Recommendation ↔ ActionItem; each tied to KPIs and Evidence for traceability.
Taxonomy: Standardized tags (domain, geography, product, function, risk class) for cross-module filtering and reporting.
Decision workflows (from intelligence to execution)
Playbooks: Crisis and strategy playbooks with phases, tasks, RACI, SLAs, and approvals.
Governance: Scenario stage gates, decision logs, sign-offs, audit trails.
Tasks and ownership: ActionItem entity with due dates, status, assignee, progress; auto-sync to Jira/Asana.
Notification layer: Priority alerts to Slack/Teams/Email with escalation rules.
AI excellence and safety
RAG with enterprise knowledge: Connect to Confluence, GDrive, SharePoint, data warehouses; document chunking + semantic search.
Scenario simulation: Monte Carlo, sensitivity analysis, “what-if” planning with configurable assumptions.
Model guardrails: PII detection/redaction, prompt templates, function-calling for deterministic actions, human-in-the-loop reviews.
Explainability: Every AI insight links to Evidence and Assumptions; confidence with calibration; bias/coverage checks.
Auto-curation: De-dup insights, cluster themes, trend surfacing, anomaly detection.
Integrations and data ingestion
System connectors: HRIS (Workday), CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot), ERP (SAP/NetSuite), Finance (NetSuite, Anaplan), Project (Jira, Asana), ITSM (ServiceNow).
Identity: SSO (Okta/Azure AD), SCIM provisioning.
Data contracts: Schema validation, freshness/quality checks, lineage, backfills.
Analytics and metrics
KPI framework: Unified metric definitions with owners, targets, thresholds, and data lineage.
Forecasting: Time series for KPIs and risks; early-warning signals.
Board-ready reporting: One-click executive packs with commentary and scenario deltas; scheduled delivery.
Experience and usability
Guided onboarding: Role-based tours, demo data packs, “First 10 minutes” flows.
Templates: Scenario and playbook libraries by industry; configurable dashboards and Saved Views.
Collaboration: Comments, mentions, threads on any entity; Meeting mode with live note-taking and instant ActionItem creation.
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard shortcuts; responsive mobile for execs on the go.
Reliability, scale, and performance
Caching + pagination + streaming for heavy views; background jobs for AI/ETL workloads.
SLOs and health checks; circuit breakers and retries on integrations.
Observability: Structured logs, metrics, traces; product analytics (funnel, retention, feature usage).
Security and compliance
Data encryption at rest/in transit, field-level encryption for sensitive attributes.
Data residency options, retention policies, legal holds.
SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001 roadmap; DLP and eDiscovery; comprehensive audit logs.
Extensibility
Public GraphQL/REST API, webhooks, event bus; signed export bundles.
Plugin framework: Custom panels, playbooks, and data transforms with sandboxed runtime.
Packaging and GTM
Editions: Core, Pro, Enterprise (RBAC, SSO, DLP, custom SLAs, VPC).
Value metrics: Seats + data sources + scenarios; add-ons for advanced AI and industry packs.
Partner ecosystem: Implementation partners, certified playbook authors, connector marketplace.
90/180/360-day roadmap (high-impact)

0–90 days: RBAC + multi-tenant; StrategicScenario and ActionItem entities; Slack/Teams notifications; Saved Views; standardized loading/error states; audit log enhancements.
90–180 days: RAG + evidence attachments; Jira/Asana/Salesforce connectors; scenario stage-gates and approvals; forecasting and anomaly detection; SSO + SCIM.
180–360 days: Simulation engine (Monte Carlo); board-report automation; plugin framework; DLP and data residency; multi-region scale.
Success metrics (sample)

Time-to-insight < 2 minutes for top workflows; 30% increase in closed-loop actions from recommendations.
90-day retention > 70% for analysts; NPS > 45 for execs; <1% alert fatigue false-positive rate.
Data freshness SLA > 95% across connected systems.
This plan turns Kairosync into a differentiated “analysis-to-action” platform: trustworthy AI, enterprise-grade governance, seamless execution workflows, and board-ready outcomes.

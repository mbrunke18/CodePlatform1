### **Phase 1: Setup (2 minutes)**
**You say:**
> *"First, YOU build your playbook. Let's use a supply chain crisis as an example. You enter your scenario name, department, key stakeholders - these are YOUR people, YOUR thresholds. Notice the badge says 'YOU DO THIS' - this is where YOU define what matters to YOUR business."*

**Customer enters:**
- Scenario: "Supply Chain Crisis" (or their choice)
- Department: "Operations"
- Stakeholders: "COO, CFO, VP Supply Chain"
- Threshold: 75%

**You say:**
> *"Now click 'Start AI Monitoring' - and watch what happens..."*

### **Phase 2-3: AI Monitoring & Alert (2 minutes)**
**You say:**
> *"See this badge? 'AI DOES THIS.' You're not sitting here watching dashboards. AI is monitoring 24/7 for the signals YOU just defined. Watch the metric climb... when it hits your 75% threshold, AI will alert you automatically."*

**[Wait for auto-transition to alert]**

**You say:**
> *"There it is! AI detected that YOUR scenario - Supply Chain Crisis - exceeded YOUR threshold. Notice it's showing YOUR stakeholders, YOUR data. This isn't a canned demo - it's tracking what YOU just entered."*

### **Phase 4-5: Decision & Execution (3 minutes)**
**Customer clicks "Review & Make Decision"**

**You say:**
> *"Now see the badge: 'YOU DECIDE.' AI gave you the recommendation, but YOU are in control. YOU make the final call. AI doesn't replace your judgment - it enhances it."*

**[Auto-transition to execution]**

**You say:**
> *"Watch this - 'YOU + AI PARTNERSHIP.' AI is executing YOUR playbook right now. See those tasks completing? That's AI coordinating all YOUR stakeholders - COO, CFO, VP Supply Chain - the exact people YOU listed. Real-time coordination across your entire team. This is what 12-minute response time looks like."*

### **Phase 6-7: Learning & Results (2-3 minutes)**
**Customer clicks "View Final Results"**

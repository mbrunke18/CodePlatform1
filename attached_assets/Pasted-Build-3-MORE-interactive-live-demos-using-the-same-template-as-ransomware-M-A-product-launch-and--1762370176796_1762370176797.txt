You have 15 business days—but most companies waste the first 5 days 
just coordinating who's responsible for what.

By the time they start the actual work, they're rushing. The response 
is incomplete. The FDA comes back harder. Consent decree. Plant shutdown.

VEXOR coordinates your entire regulatory response team in 12 minutes. 

Day 1: You have your team aligned, work streams assigned, external 
counsel engaged, and a comprehensive response plan.

You use the full 15 days for quality work—not coordination meetings."

HEADLINE: "From customer crisis to save plan in 12 minutes"

KEY TALKING POINTS FOR THIS DEMO:
"When your largest customer escalates to the CEO, you have maybe 
48 hours to save the relationship.

But coordination takes 24-36 hours:
- Who owns the relationship? 
- What went wrong technically?
- What's the save plan?
- Who's in the executive meeting?

By the time you're aligned, you're walking into that meeting 
unprepared. And you lose the $120M customer.

VEXOR coordinates your save plan in 12 minutes.

Within an hour, you have:
- Complete root cause analysis
- Technical remediation plan
- Product roadmap commitments
- Financial concessions approved
- Executive presentation ready

You spend 47 hours perfecting the save plan—not scheduling 
meetings to create it."

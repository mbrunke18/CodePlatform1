# Bastion Systematic Framework

## From NFL Coach Methodology to Product Architecture

-----

## The Core Systematic Approach (Your Foundation)

### The 4-Phase Elite Decision Framework

**Phase 1: RECOGNIZE → All Possible Situations**

- Catalog every scenario that could occur
- Create playbook with pre-filled templates (80%+ data fields captured)
- Build institutional knowledge library

**Phase 2: PREPARE → Gameplan Execution**

- Design response play for each situation
- Map all roles, tasks, and communications
- Pre-assign stakeholders and responsibilities
- Create decision trees and action sequences

**Phase 3: TRIGGER → Data Point Monitoring**

- Establish specific data points that signal each situation
- Build alert system that recognizes pattern matches
- Automate situation detection and playbook suggestion
- Enable real-time monitoring across all signal sources

**Phase 4: LEARN → Monitor and Improve**

- Capture execution data from every activation
- Analyze what worked vs. what didn’t
- Refine playbooks based on real-world performance
- Build predictive intelligence from historical patterns

-----

## Current Product State vs. Systematic Framework

### What’s Already Built (Implicit in Current Product Story)

✅ **Phase 1 (Recognize)**: 110 pre-configured playbook templates
✅ **Phase 2 (Prepare)**: Playbooks include roles, tasks, communications
✅ **Phase 3 (Trigger)**: AI monitors 847+ signals, triggers fire
✅ **Phase 4 (Learn)**: “Institutional memory” mentioned but underdeveloped

### What Needs Enhancement (The Gaps)

🔄 **Phase 1 Enhancement**: Systematic situation taxonomy
🔄 **Phase 2 Enhancement**: Practice mode and execution rehearsal
🔄 **Phase 3 Enhancement**: Custom trigger builder and pattern recognition
🔄 **Phase 4 Enhancement**: Learning engine and continuous improvement

-----

## PHASE 1 ENHANCEMENT: Situation Recognition Engine

### Current State

- 110 playbook templates (good starting point)
- Templates described but not systematically organized
- Unclear how comprehensive the coverage is

### Systematic Enhancement: The Situation Taxonomy System™

**1.1 Comprehensive Situation Mapping**

Build a hierarchical taxonomy of ALL possible business situations:

```
LEVEL 1: Strategic Domains (8 categories)
├─ Competitive Threats
├─ Operational Disruptions  
├─ Financial Crises
├─ Regulatory/Legal Issues
├─ Technology Failures
├─ Human Capital Events
├─ Market Disruptions
├─ Reputational Crises

LEVEL 2: Situation Categories (47 subcategories)
Example under "Competitive Threats":
├─ New Market Entrant
├─ Competitor Product Launch
├─ Pricing Disruption
├─ Patent Challenge
├─ Key Talent Poached
└─ Technology Breakthrough

LEVEL 3: Specific Scenarios (110+ playbooks)
Example under "Technology Breakthrough":
├─ AI Capability Announcement
├─ Manufacturing Innovation
├─ Distribution Disruption
└─ Customer Experience Revolution
```

**1.2 The 80% Template Rule (Your Core Insight)**

Each playbook template must have **80%+ pre-filled data fields**:

```
PLAYBOOK TEMPLATE: Competitor AI Breakthrough (#14)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  - Media statement (draft ready)
  - Employee town hall script (draft ready)
✓ Decision Tree: 12 decision points mapped
✓ Budget Authority: $5M emergency response fund pre-approved
✓ External Resources: List of 8 crisis consultants on retainer
✓ Legal Requirements: 3 regulatory notifications required
✓ Success Metrics: Market share retention, customer churn rate, media sentiment

CUSTOMIZABLE FIELDS (20%):
○ Specific competitor name

```

**1.3 Situation Coverage Analysis Tool**

Product Feature: **Playbook Coverage Dashboard**

- Shows % of potential situations with playbooks
- Identifies gaps in coverage
- Suggests new playbooks based on industry/company profile
- Benchmarks against peer organizations

Build 3 new interactive live demos using the ransomware demo as a template.

CURRENT STATE:
We have 1 working demo (Ransomware Response) with:
- 12-minute timer
- Stakeholder coordination tracking
- 80% threshold detection
- Final metrics and celebration
- Located at: [INSERT PATH TO CURRENT DEMO COMPONENT]

OBJECTIVE:
Create 3 NEW demos that follow the exact same pattern but with different scenarios:
1. M&A Integration
2. Product Launch (Multi-Country)
3. Supplier Crisis

Each demo should have identical UX/flow but different:
- Scenario name and description
- Stakeholder list (different roles/titles)
- Event timeline (what happens during coordination)
- Final impact metrics (financial value)

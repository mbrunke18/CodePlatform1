# WHAT TO EXPECT & HOW TO VERIFY

-----

## REPLIT WILL PROBABLY DO 60-70% CORRECTLY

Here’s what you should see happen over the next 10-30 minutes:

### **What Replit AI Will Likely Build Successfully:**

✅ **Homepage hero updates** with new AI-focused messaging  
✅ **Basic component structure** for AI features section  
✅ **Updated badges and taglines** with AI positioning  
✅ **Three scenario cards** (Crisis/Opportunity/Innovation) with speed stats  
✅ **Styling and layout** (it’s good at UI)

### **What Replit AI Will Likely Miss or Break:**

❌ **Real API integration** (will use mock data)  
❌ **AI feature implementation** (will show UI, but no actual AI)  
❌ **Database schema updates** (might not update properly)  
❌ **Complex state management** (real-time updates, coordination logic)  
❌ **Authentication flow** (will reference it but not actually work)

-----

## YOUR VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Next 1 Hour)

### **STEP 1: Let Replit Finish (10-20 minutes)**

Watch the Replit terminal for:

```bash
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ Building client...
✓ Building server...
✓ Starting development server...
```

**Don’t interrupt** while it’s working. Let it complete.

-----

### **STEP 2: Check What Got Built (5 minutes)**

Once Replit finishes, open the preview and check:

#### **Homepage Hero:**

- [ ] Does headline say “The World Won’t Wait for You to Coordinate”?
- [ ] Does it have the three scenario cards (Crisis/Opportunity/Innovation)?
- [ ] Do the speed stats show (90 min vs 17 days, etc.)?
- [ ] Is there an AI badge or AI messaging?

#### **AI Features Section:**

- [ ] Is there a section about “AI That Orchestrates”?
- [ ] Does it show the 4 AI capabilities (Detection, Structuring, Orchestration, Learning)?
- [ ] Is it styled properly?

#### **Overall Design:**

- [ ] Does it look professional?
- [ ] Are colors consistent with your brand?
- [ ] Is it responsive (resize browser to mobile width)?

-----

### **STEP 3: Test Basic Navigation (5 minutes)**

Click around and verify:

```bash
# Test these routes
✓ Homepage (/) - Does it load?
✓ /playbooks - Does it exist?
✓ /decisions - Does it exist?
✓ /execution/demo - Does it exist?

# Common errors you might see
❌ "404 Not Found" - Route doesn't exist yet
❌ Blank page - Component crashed
❌ Loading spinner forever - API call failing
```

-----

### **STEP 4: Open Browser DevTools (Critical)**

**Mac:** `Cmd + Option + J`  
**Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + J`

Look for errors in Console tab:

#### **Good signs:**

```
✓ No red error messages
✓ API calls showing in Network tab
✓ React components rendering
```

#### **Bad signs (common issues):**

```
❌ "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
   → Means data isn't loading properly

❌ "Failed to fetch /api/playbooks"
   → API route doesn't exist or crashed

❌ "Unexpected token < in JSON"
   → Server returning HTML instead of JSON (route misconfigured)

❌ "Module not found: '@/components/...'
   → Import path is wrong
```

-----

### **STEP 5: Check Database Schema (10 minutes)**

**This is critical.** Verify Replit updated your schema correctly.

```bash
# In Replit terminal, run:
npm run db:push
```

**Expected output:**

```
✓ Pulling schema from database...
✓ Changes detected:
  - Added column: executionTimeMinutes to activeResponses
  - Added column: taskStatuses to activeResponses
✓ Applying changes...
✓ Done!
```

**If you see errors:**

```
❌ "Relation 'activeDecisions' already exists"
   → Old table name conflict, need to manually fix

❌ "Data loss warning: dropping column..."
   → Schema change will delete data, add --force flag if OK

❌ "Connection refused"
   → Database isn't running or credentials wrong
```

**If schema update fails, you’ll need to manually fix it.**

-----

### **STEP 6: Test a Simple Data Flow (15 minutes)**

Try to create a playbook or decision tree:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to /playbooks or /decisions
# 2. Try to create a new item
# 3. Fill out the form
# 4. Click "Save" or "Create"

# What to watch for:
✓ Form validates input
✓ "Creating..." loading state shows
✓ Success message appears
✓ New item appears in list

# Common failures:
❌ Nothing happens when you click Save
   → Event handler not connected

❌ Error toast appears immediately
   → API route crashed or validation failed

❌ Loading spinner never stops
   → API call hanging (check Network tab)

❌ Success message but item doesn't appear
   → Database write succeeded but query refresh failed
```

-----

## WHAT TO DO WHEN THINGS BREAK (They Will)

### **Issue 1: Homepage Loads But Looks Broken**

**Symptoms:**

- Layout is weird
- Text overlapping
- Cards misaligned

**Fix:**

```typescript
// Check client/src/pages/HomePage.tsx
// Look for missing closing tags or div wrappers

// Common mistake Replit makes:
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
  <CardContent>  // ❌ Missing </CardHeader>
  
// Should be:
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
```

-----

### **Issue 2: “Cannot GET /api/playbooks”**

**Symptoms:**

- Page shows loading spinner forever
- Console error: “Failed to fetch”
- Network tab shows 404 for API call

**Fix:**

```typescript
// Check server/routes.ts
// Make sure route exists:

app.get('/api/playbooks', optionalAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // ... route handler
});

// If missing, add it manually
// If present but still failing, check for:
// - Typo in route path
// - Missing 'optionalAuth' or 'requireAuth' import
// - Async/await error in handler
```

-----

### **Issue 3: Data Shows But It’s Mock Data**

**Symptoms:**

- Page displays perfectly
- Data looks reasonable
- But it’s the same every time (hardcoded)

**Fix:**

```typescript
// Check the component file
// Look for hardcoded data:

// ❌ WRONG (mock data)
const playbooks = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Data Breach Response' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Market Entry' }
];

// ✅ RIGHT (real query)
const { data: playbooks, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['/api/playbooks'],
});

// Replace mock arrays with real useQuery calls
```

-----

### **Issue 4: Authentication Errors**

**Symptoms:**

- “Unauthorized” errors on every API call
- Can’t access any data
- Console shows 401 errors

**Fix (Temporary Workaround):**

```typescript
// In server/routes.ts, temporarily disable auth:

// Change this:
app.get('/api/playbooks', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {

// To this (TEMPORARY):
app.get('/api/playbooks', async (req, res) => {
  const organizationId = 'demo-org-id'; // Hardcode for testing
  
// This lets you test without auth
// But YOU MUST FIX AUTH before customer demo
```

-----

### **Issue 5: Database Schema Mismatch**

**Symptoms:**

- “Column does not exist” errors
- “Table does not exist” errors
- API calls return empty data

**Fix:**

```bash
# Force push schema (WARNING: May lose data)
npm run db:push --force

# If that fails, manually drop tables:
npm run db:studio

# In Drizzle Studio UI:
# - Navigate to each table
# - Click "Delete table"
# - Then run: npm run db:push
```

-----

## THE CRITICAL PATH TEST (30 minutes)

**After Replit finishes and you’ve verified basics, test this workflow:**

### **Test 1: Can You View the Homepage?**

```
1. Navigate to /
2. ✓ Homepage loads without errors
3. ✓ All sections visible (hero, AI features, scenarios)
4. ✓ No console errors
```

### **Test 2: Can You View Mock Execution Dashboard?**

```
1. Navigate to /execution/demo
2. ✓ Dashboard loads
3. ✓ Shows tasks with status
4. ✓ Shows progress indicators
5. ⚠️ It's probably mock data (that's OK for now)
```

### **Test 3: Can You Create a Simple Playbook?**

```
1. Navigate to /playbooks/new (or wherever Replit put it)
2. Fill out form (name, domain, description)
3. Click Save
4. ✓ Success message appears
5. ✓ New playbook appears in list
6. ⚠️ If this fails, auth or database issue
```

-----

## WHAT TO SHARE WITH ME AFTER VERIFICATION

**In your next message, tell me:**

### **1. What Works:**

```
✓ Homepage hero loaded with new messaging
✓ Three scenario cards visible
✓ AI features section present
✓ Routing works (/playbooks, /decisions exist)
```

### **2. What’s Broken:**

```
❌ API calls return 404
❌ Database schema didn't update
❌ Auth is blocking everything
❌ Mock data showing instead of real data
```

### **3. Console Errors:**

```
Copy/paste the top 3-5 errors from browser console
```

### **4. What You Want to Fix First:**

```
Priority 1: Get database working
Priority 2: Remove mock data
Priority 3: Build real AI features
etc.
```

-----

## MY PREDICTION: WHAT YOU’LL SEE

### **70% Probability:**

- ✅ Homepage looks great (Replit is good at UI)
- ✅ New messaging and AI positioning present
- ⚠️ Everything uses mock data (not connected to real API)
- ❌ Database schema partially updated (some tables missing)
- ❌ Auth references present but not working
- ❌ Real-time updates not implemented

### **What This Means:**

You’ll have a **beautiful demo UI** but the **backend plumbing** will need manual fixes.

**That’s actually good progress.** UI is 40% of the work. You can now:

1. Show the vision to prospects (even with mock data)
1. Use it for fundraising deck screenshots
1. Manually wire up the backend over next few days

-----

## TIME ALLOCATION FOR FIXES (Next 3 Days)

### **Day 1 (Today): Assess & Prioritize**

- 1 hour: Full verification of what Replit built
- 2 hours: Fix any breaking errors (can’t load pages, console crashes)
- 1 hour: Replace most obvious mock data with real queries
- **Goal:** Working demo (even if partially mock data)

### **Day 2: Database & APIs**

- 2 hours: Fix database schema (consolidate to activeResponses)
- 2 hours: Wire up real API routes for playbooks and decisions
- 2 hours: Replace remaining mock data with real queries
- **Goal:** All data comes from database, no mock data

### **Day 3: Real-Time & Polish**

- 3 hours: Implement polling for execution dashboard
- 2 hours: Add error handling and loading states
- 1 hour: Test critical path end-to-end
- **Goal:** Production-ready for pilot customer demo

-----

## THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

**Don’t get discouraged if things are broken.**

Replit is a tool. AI agents are assistants. They get you 60-70% there.

**The last 30-40% is always manual.**

That’s true whether you use Replit, or hire a developer, or build it yourself.

**You’re not looking for perfection today. You’re looking for:**

1. ✅ Visual proof of concept (can show to prospects)
1. ✅ Architectural foundation (schema, routes, components exist)
1. ✅ Clear list of what needs fixing (prioritized backlog)

**If you have those three things after Replit finishes, you’re in great shape.**

-----

## WHEN REPLIT FINISHES

**Screenshot these for me:**

1. Homepage hero section
1. AI features section
1. One of the scenario cards (Crisis/Opportunity/Innovation)
1. Browser console (showing any errors)
1. File structure (left sidebar in Replit showing what files were created)

**And tell me:**

- What route loads successfully?
- What route crashes?
- What data is real vs mock?
- What’s your biggest concern?

**Then we’ll prioritize fixes and get you to a working demo.**

-----

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Replit will give you a head start. Not a finished product.**

**Expect 60-70% done, 30-40% manual fixes needed.**

**That’s still way better than starting from scratch.**

**Now let it cook and let’s see what we get.** 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

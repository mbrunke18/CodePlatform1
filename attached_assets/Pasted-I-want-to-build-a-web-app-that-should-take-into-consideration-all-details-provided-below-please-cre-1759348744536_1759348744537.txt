I want to build a web app that should take into consideration all details provided below, please create the complete web app for me including front end and back end code, database setup if necessary and deployment instructions so I can host the app online.  

Assume I have no coding experience, and you are to act as a senior developer with strong UI/UX experience eand  Generate the code, explain how to run it, and recommend beginner friendly tools for editing and deploying the app.

Purpose:
Build an enterprise web app that provides executives the ability to make strategic decisions around change management situations, where the end use can identify critical situations, ability to customize what if analysis situations and develop prepared response plans, roadmaps, and execution plans for each scenario along with analytics, track progress and provide oversight.  This stems from an approach NFL and elite college football coaches use to make critical decisions in less than minute. They prepare for every and all situations and scenarios they may face and create a playbook to execute from if and when a situation arises.  They practice the plays so they can execute with the right work, roles and team members to deliver upon. There is more to it than what I’ve shared but it’s the basis for this web app


Key design and layout consideration:
	1. Home page
	2. Executive Dashboard
	3. Situation Page
	4. What if scenario page
	5. Prepared Response page
	6. Implementation page
	7. Go / Execution plan page

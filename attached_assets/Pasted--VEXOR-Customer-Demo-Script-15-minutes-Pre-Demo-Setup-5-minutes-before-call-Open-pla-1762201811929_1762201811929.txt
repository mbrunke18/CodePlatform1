# VEXOR Customer Demo Script (15 minutes)

## Pre-Demo Setup (5 minutes before call)
- [ ] Open /playbook-library in browser
- [ ] Have Ransomware playbook customized and ready
- [ ] Clear browser console
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection
- [ ] Have activation ready to trigger
- [ ] Rehearse once

## MINUTE 0-2: THE HOOK
"Thank you for joining. In the next 15 minutes, I'm going to show you 
something that will change how your company executes strategy.

The problem: When your CEO decides to launch a product, integrate an 
acquisition, or respond to a crisis—how long does it take to coordinate 
everyone? 48 hours? 72 hours? 

VEXOR coordinates your entire organization in 12 minutes. And I'm going 
to prove it to you live, right now."

## MINUTE 2-5: THE LIBRARY
[Share screen: /playbook-library]

"We've pre-built 148 strategic playbooks based on real Fortune 1000 scenarios.

Let me show you one: Ransomware Response. [Click]

You see 8 sections—all 80% pre-filled with best practices from companies 
like Microsoft, Bank of America, Toyota.

The genius: You customize 20% to your organization—just add your people's 
names. Takes 2 hours, not 2 months."

## MINUTE 5-7: THE CUSTOMIZATION
"When we work together, we'll customize this for [Customer Company].

You'd just map your executives to these roles:
- CEO → [Customer CEO Name]
- CISO → [Customer CISO Name]
- CFO → [Customer CFO Name]

Takes one afternoon. Then you have a playbook ready to activate."

## MINUTE 7-9: THE ACTIVATION
"Now here's where it gets powerful. Let me show you what happens when 
you activate.

[Click "Activate Playbook"]

Watch the timer. This is REAL—not a simulation. Right now:
- 30 stakeholders are being notified [show console logs]
- Tasks are being distributed
- Coordination is starting

[WebSocket updates start appearing]

See them acknowledging in real-time?
- Sarah CFO acknowledged after 47 seconds
- Marcus CTO acknowledged after 1 minute

This is actual organizational coordination happening."

## MINUTE 9-12: THE WAIT (FILL TIME)
While coordination is running:

"Let me tell you what's happening behind the scenes:

Each stakeholder received:
- Email with their role and tasks
- Slack message with acknowledge button  
- SMS if configured

They click one button to acknowledge. That's it.

Compare this to your current process:
- Email sent
- Wait for calendar availability
- Schedule meeting
- Half the people miss it
- Follow-up emails
- 48-72 hours later, maybe everyone's aligned

VEXOR does this in minutes, not days."

[Check progress - should be near completion]

## MINUTE 12-14: THE PROOF
[Coordination completes]

"There it is. 11 minutes, 47 seconds. 28 out of 30 acknowledged.

Let me show you what this means: [Pull up comparison]

WITHOUT VEXOR: 
- 48-72 hours to coordinate
- By then, ransomware has spread
- Data is exfiltrated  
- $27M in recovery costs [real LoanDepot example]

WITH VEXOR:
- 12 minutes to coordinate
- Response begins while threat is containable
- $283,000 saved in executive time alone
- Crisis prevented, not just managed

The ROI is obvious. But the real value? Speed is the competitive advantage."

## MINUTE 14-15: THE CLOSE
"This is VEXOR. You've already invested millions in AI detection systems.

We're the execution layer that makes those investments deliver ROI.

We don't replace your technology. We're how you ACT on what you detect—
at the speed your business actually moves.

Three questions:
1. Do you have strategic decisions that take days to coordinate?
2. Do those delays cost you opportunities or increase your risk?
3. Would 10x faster coordination create competitive advantage?

If you answered yes to any of these, we should talk about a pilot.

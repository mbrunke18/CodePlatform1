# WHAT TO WATCH FOR WHEN REPLIT FINISHES

-----

## CRITICAL: SET EXPECTATIONS NOW

**You just gave Replit AI Agent a MASSIVE amount of context:**

- Updated positioning (AI-powered coordination)
- New homepage hero (world won’t wait messaging)
- AI feature descriptions
- Complete implementation examples
- Schema updates
- Multiple messaging frameworks

**Here’s what will likely happen:**

-----

## SCENARIO 1: REPLIT BUILDS THE UI BUT MISSES THE LOGIC (70% PROBABILITY)

### **What you’ll see:**

✅ Beautiful homepage with new messaging  
✅ AI feature cards with icons and descriptions  
✅ Three scenario comparison cards (Crisis/Opportunity/Innovation)  
✅ “Adapt at AI Speed” tagline everywhere

### **What will be missing:**

❌ Actual AI scenario matching (OpenAI integration)  
❌ Real-time execution coordination logic  
❌ Automated handoff resolution  
❌ Document template population with AI  
❌ Database queries for real data (still mock data)

### **Why this happens:**

Replit AI is excellent at **UI implementation** but doesn’t understand **business logic priorities**.

It will build what LOOKS impressive but not what WORKS functionally.

-----

## SCENARIO 2: REPLIT USES OLD SCHEMA (60% PROBABILITY)

### **The problem:**

You’ve now given Replit THREE different schema versions:

1. Original `activeDecisions` (decision-only)
1. Separate `executionInstances` (execution-only)
1. Unified `activeResponses` (decision + execution combined)

### **What will probably happen:**

Replit will pick ONE inconsistently and create a Frankenstein database.

### **How to check:**

```bash
# After Replit finishes, immediately run:
cat shared/schema.ts | grep "export const"

# Look for what tables exist:
# ✅ CORRECT: activeResponses (unified table)
# ❌ WRONG: activeDecisions + executionInstances (separate tables)
# ❌ WRONG: Some hybrid mess
```

### **If it’s wrong:**

You’ll need to manually replace the schema with the unified version.

-----

## SCENARIO 3: REPLIT DOESN’T INTEGRATE AI (90% PROBABILITY)

### **What you’ll see:**

Beautiful UI that says “AI-Powered Scenario Detection” but when you click it… nothing happens.

### **Why:**

AI integration requires:

1. OpenAI API key setup
1. Environment variables
1. External API calls
1. Error handling
1. Rate limiting

Replit AI Agent can write the CODE PATTERN but can’t actually CONFIGURE the service.

### **What to do:**

You’ll need to manually:

```bash
# 1. Sign up for OpenAI
# Go to platform.openai.com
# Create API key

# 2. Add to .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env

# 3. Install package
npm install openai

# 4. Test the integration
# Create a simple test endpoint first
```

**This is NOT a Replit failure. This is just reality—external service configuration requires manual setup.**

-----

## SCENARIO 4: FOOTBALL TERMINOLOGY IS STILL THERE (80% PROBABILITY)

### **The problem:**

Even though you said “remove Tom Brady from homepage,” the code reference STILL had football terms in the IDEA phase descriptions.

### **What you’ll see:**

Homepage hero: ✅ Clean (no Brady)  
IDEA Framework cards: ❌ Still say “Game Film,” “Scout the Field,” “Run the Play”

### **Why:**

AI agents follow the MOST RECENT detailed instructions. Since the code reference had football terms in the phase data structure, Replit used that.

### **What to do:**

Manual find/replace after Replit finishes:

- “Build Your Depth Chart” → “Build Your Playbooks”
- “Scout the Field” → “Monitor Signals”
- “Run the Play” → “Execute Response”
- “Review the Film” → “Capture Lessons”

-----

## SCENARIO 5: MESSAGING IS INCONSISTENT (70% PROBABILITY)

### **The problem:**

You gave Replit multiple tagline options:

- “From Signal to Action in Days. Not Months.”
- “The World Won’t Wait for You to Coordinate”
- “Adapt at AI Speed. Not Meeting Speed.”
- “Your Employees Have AI. Your Organization Doesn’t.”

### **What will happen:**

Replit will pick ONE for the homepage, but use DIFFERENT ones on other pages.

### **What you’ll see:**

- Homepage: “The World Won’t Wait”
- Pricing page: “From Signal to Action”
- About page: “Adapt at AI Speed”

### **Why this is a problem:**

Inconsistent messaging confuses users. You need ONE primary tagline everywhere.

### **What to do:**

After Replit finishes, decide on your PRIMARY tagline and make it consistent across:

- Homepage hero
- Navigation header
- Footer
- Pricing page
- About page
- All CTAs

-----

## YOUR 2-HOUR POST-REPLIT CHECKLIST

### **HOUR 1: VERIFICATION (What did Replit actually build?)**

```bash
# ✓ 1. Check if app runs
npm run dev
# Does it load without errors?

# ✓ 2. Check schema
cat shared/schema.ts | grep "pgTable"
# Are tables unified or fragmented?

# ✓ 3. Check homepage
# Open http://localhost:5000
# Is the new messaging present?

# ✓ 4. Check AI features
# Click any "AI-powered" feature
# Does it do anything or just show static UI?

# ✓ 5. Check routes
cat client/src/App.tsx | grep "Route"
# Are all pages created?

# ✓ 6. Check API endpoints
cat server/routes.ts | grep "app.get\|app.post"
# Are the new routes implemented?

# ✓ 7. Test database connection
npm run db:studio
# Can you see tables?
```

-----

### **HOUR 2: CRITICAL FIXES (What you MUST fix before demo)**

**Priority 1: Schema Cleanup**

```bash
# If schema is wrong, replace it manually
# Use the unified activeResponses table version

# Then push to database
npm run db:push --force
```

**Priority 2: Remove Mock Data**

```typescript
// Find all instances of hardcoded data
grep -r "const activeResponse = {" client/src/

// Replace with real queries
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['/api/active-responses', id],
});
```

**Priority 3: Messaging Consistency**

```bash
# Pick ONE tagline and find/replace everywhere
# Recommended: "The World Won't Wait for You to Coordinate"

grep -r "Adapt at AI Speed" client/src/
# Replace with your chosen primary tagline
```

**Priority 4: Football Terminology**

```bash
# Find and replace
grep -r "Game Film\|Scout the Field\|Run the Play" client/src/

# Replace with generic versions
```

**Priority 5: Auth Setup (IF showing to customers)**

```bash
# If you need working auth for demo
# Follow Clerk setup steps from earlier
# This is 30-45 minutes but REQUIRED for customer demos
```

-----

## THE CRITICAL PATH TEST (Run This Immediately)

**Can you execute this workflow end-to-end?**

```
1. CREATE DECISION TREE
   → Go to /decision-trees/new
   → Fill out form
   → Click Save
   → VERIFY: Does it save to database?
   → VERIFY: Does it appear in list?

2. VIEW DECISION TREES
   → Go to /decision-trees
   → VERIFY: See the tree you just created?
   → VERIFY: Can you click into it?

3. TRIGGER EXECUTION
   → Click "Trigger This Scenario"
   → VERIFY: Creates activeResponse record?
   → VERIFY: Redirects to execution dashboard?

4. VIEW EXECUTION DASHBOARD
   → Should see task list
   → VERIFY: Tasks appear?
   → VERIFY: Can you change task status?
   → VERIFY: Does progress bar update?

5. COMPLETE EXECUTION
   → Mark all tasks complete
   → VERIFY: Logs to decision_log table?
   → VERIFY: Shows on velocity dashboard?
```

**If ANY step fails, the product isn’t demo-ready.**

## WHAT TO EXPECT: REALISTIC OUTCOMES

### **Best Case (20% probability):**

- ✅ Homepage looks great with new messaging
- ✅ Schema is mostly correct (might have minor issues)
- ✅ Routes are created
- ✅ Components render
- ⚠️ Still using mock data
- ⚠️ AI features are UI-only (no actual AI)
- ⚠️ Auth not configured
- ⚠️ Some messaging inconsistencies

**Time to production-ready:** 8-12 hours of manual fixes

-----

### **Most Likely (60% probability):**

- ✅ Homepage looks good
- ✅ Most components created
- ⚠️ Schema has issues (mixed old/new)
- ⚠️ Some routes missing
- ⚠️ Mock data everywhere
- ⚠️ AI features are just UI
- ⚠️ Football terms still present
- ❌ Auth not working
- ❌ Critical path workflow broken

**Time to production-ready:** 16-24 hours of manual fixes

-----

### **Worst Case (20% probability):**

- ✅ Some UI components created
- ❌ Schema is a mess
- ❌ Routes incomplete
- ❌ App doesn’t run (build errors)
- ❌ Everything is mock data
- ❌ Critical workflows don’t work

**Time to production-ready:** 40+ hours (might be faster to rebuild key pieces manually)

-----

## THE IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **When Replit Finishes:**

**Step 1: Take a breath (30 seconds)**
Don’t immediately panic if it’s not perfect. Replit gave you a HUGE head start even if it’s only 60% right.

**Step 2: Run the app (2 minutes)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Does it load? If yes, you’re in good shape. If no, check errors.

**Step 3: Click around (5 minutes)**

- Homepage loads?
- Can you navigate to different pages?
- Do buttons work?
- Are there console errors?

**Step 4: Check the database (3 minutes)**

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

What tables exist? Do they match the unified schema or old schema?

**Step 5: Test critical path (10 minutes)**
Try to create → trigger → execute a decision tree. How far do you get?

**Step 6: Make a decision (5 minutes)**
Based on what you found:

- **If 70%+ works:** Fix the remaining 30% yourself (next 8-12 hours)
- **If 40-70% works:** Fix the major issues first (next 16-24 hours)
- **If <40% works:** Cherry-pick the good parts and rebuild critical pieces (next 40+ hours)

-----

## THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

**Replit is a TOOL, not a MAGIC WAND.**

It will get you:

- ✅ 60-80% of the UI implementation
- ✅ 40-60% of the backend logic
- ✅ 20-30% of the complex business logic
- ✅ 0% of external service configuration

**You still need to:**

- ❌ Fix schema inconsistencies
- ❌ Replace mock data with real queries
- ❌ Configure authentication
- ❌ Set up OpenAI integration
- ❌ Test and debug the critical path
- ❌ Polish messaging consistency

**That’s NORMAL and EXPECTED.**

Replit saved you 40-60 hours of coding. You still have 12-24 hours of work to make it production-ready.

**That’s still a massive win.**

-----

## WHAT TO TELL ME WHEN IT FINISHES

**Send me this:**

1. **Does the app run?** (Yes/No + error if No)
1. **What does the schema look like?** (activeDecisions or activeResponses or mess?)
1. **What pages were created?** (List the routes in App.tsx)
1. **Does the critical path work?** (Create → Trigger → Execute → Complete)
1. **What’s the biggest issue you see?** (Schema? Mock data? Missing logic? Auth?)

**Then I can give you a prioritized fix list for the next 8-12 hours.**

-----

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Replit will give you a GREAT starting point.**

**It will NOT give you a finished product.**

**Expect to spend 12-24 hours fixing/polishing what it built.**

**That’s still 3-5X faster than building from scratch.**

**Now wait for Replit to finish, then run the verification checklist, and report back what you find.**

**We’ll tackle the fixes together based on what actually needs fixing.**

**You’ve got this. Let’s see what Replit delivers.** 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Slide-by-Slide Messaging

### Slide 1: Title

**M Platform**
The Strategic Execution Operating System

*Execute strategy at the speed of disruption*

-----

### Slide 2: The Problem

**The $2.7 Trillion Execution Gap**

McKinsey research reveals that even high-performing companies capture only 70% of their strategy’s potential value.

For a Fortune 500 company, that’s **$270M-$900M left on the table annually**—not from bad strategy, but from failed execution.

The gap isn’t intelligence. It’s coordination.

-----

### Slide 3: Why Now

**Three forces are converging:**

1. **Consulting saturation** — Companies spend $50B/year on strategy consulting, but consultants leave when the deck is done
1. **Operating model overhauls** — 67% of enterprises redesigned their operating model in the past 2 years (McKinsey, 2025)
1. **Execution speed demands** — Markets move in days, not quarters. The 72-hour response window is now 12 minutes.

**The result:** A massive gap between *designed* operating models and *executed* strategy.

-----

### Slide 4: The Solution

**M Platform: The Execution Layer**

We built the first Strategic Execution Operating System—the software that turns operating model design into coordinated action.

|Consultants Design         |M Platform Executes     |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
|12 operating model elements|148 pre-staged playbooks|
|Fingerprint on paper       |Fingerprint in software |
|“Here’s what to build”     |“Here’s how to run it”  |

**McKinsey gives you the blueprint. M Platform builds the house.**

-----

### Slide 5: How It Works

**PREPARE → MONITOR → EXECUTE → LEARN**

**PREPARE**

- Map your operating model to execution playbooks
- Pre-stage responses across 8 strategic domains
- Assign accountability before events occur

**MONITOR**

- Real-time triggers across market, competitive, regulatory signals
- AI pattern recognition from 10,000+ scenarios
- Early warning before disruption hits

**EXECUTE**

- 12-minute coordinated response (vs. 72-hour industry average)
- Automated stakeholder routing and escalation
- Cross-functional alignment in a single command center

**LEARN**

- Automated retrospectives capture what worked
- Playbooks improve with every execution cycle
- Institutional knowledge compounds, not walks out the door

-----

### Slide 6: The 8 Strategic Domains

**148 Playbooks. Every Strategic Scenario.**

|Domain              |Playbooks|Example                                                       |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|Crisis Response     |24       |Executive crisis, reputational threat, supply chain disruption|
|Cyber Incidents     |18       |Ransomware, data breach, insider threat                       |
|Market Entry        |22       |New geography, new segment, channel expansion                 |
|M&A Integration     |16       |Day 1 readiness, synergy capture, culture integration         |
|Product Launch      |20       |Go-to-market, competitive positioning, launch recovery        |
|Competitive Response|18       |Price war, feature parity, talent poaching                    |
|Regulatory Change   |14       |Compliance pivot, policy response, audit preparation          |
|Transformation      |16       |Restructuring, digital transformation, operating model shift  |

**Not just defense. Offense too.**

-----

### Slide 7: Operating Model Alignment (NEW FEATURE)

**From Fingerprint to Execution**

M Platform’s Operating Model Alignment maps your organizational design choices to specific execution playbooks.

**The 12 Elements:**
Purpose • Value Agenda • Structure • Ecosystem • Leadership • Governance • Processes • Technology • Behaviors • Rewards • Footprint • Talent

**The Output:**

- Diagnostic assessment across all 12 elements
- Strategy-execution gap score vs. industry benchmarks
- Prioritized playbook recommendations
- Four outcomes tracking: Clarity, Speed, Skills, Commitment

**“You’ve invested $2M in operating model design. Now execute it.”**

-----

### Slide 8: The Origin Story

**From Sideline to Boardroom**

Before enterprise software, I spent 5 years coordinating elite athletes under pressure—as a major college football coach.

When a play breaks down, you don’t have 72 hours. You have 40 seconds.

**What makes that possible:**

- Pre-staged plays for every scenario
- Clear accountability (11 players, 11 assignments)
- Instant communication (signals, not meetings)
- Continuous improvement (film review after every game)

I spent 20 years at Ford, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly, and Churchill Downs wondering: **Why doesn’t the boardroom work like the sideline?**

M Platform is the answer.

-----

### Slide 9: Market Opportunity

**Creating a New Category: SEOS**

|Market                            |Size          |M Platform Position           |
|----------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
|Adjacent: GRC, Incident Management|$825M         |Not competing here            |
|Strategy Consulting               |$50B          |Execution layer for this spend|
|**Strategic Execution OS**        |**$5B+ (new)**|**Category creator**          |

**Comparable category creations:**

- Salesforce: CRM ($250B market cap)
- ServiceNow: IT Service Management ($150B market cap)
- Workday: HCM ($60B market cap)

**Each created a category. Each captured the majority of it.**

-----

### Slide 10: Business Model

**Land, Expand, Compound**

|Phase       |Model                          |Revenue        |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
|**Pilot**   |90-day proof of value          |$75K           |
|**Land**    |Single domain (e.g., Cyber)    |$250K ARR      |
|**Expand**  |Multi-domain enterprise license|$750K-$1.5M ARR|
|**Compound**|Platform + playbook marketplace|TBD            |

**Unit Economics Target:**

- CAC: $50K (pilot-led, no enterprise sales team at scale)
- ACV: $500K (blended)
- LTV: $2.5M (5-year, expansion-driven)
- Payback: <6 months

-----

-----

### Slide 14: Vision

**The Future of Strategic Execution**

Every enterprise has:

- An ERP for operations (SAP)
- A CRM for customers (Salesforce)
- An HCM for people (Workday)

None of them have an **execution system for strategy**.

M Platform will be the operating system that turns strategic intent into coordinated action—across every domain, for every company, at the speed of disruption.

**We’re not building a better crisis tool. We’re building the central nervous system of the enterprise.**

        What makes that possible isn't superhuman speed—it's pre-staged plays, 
        clear accountability, instant communication, and continuous improvement.

        I spent 20 years at Ford, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly, and 
        Churchill Downs asking the same question: <strong>Why doesn't the 
        boardroom work like the sideline?</strong>

### About Page

```html
<section class="about-hero">
  <h1>Building the Execution Layer for Strategy</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    M Platform is creating a new category: the Strategic Execution Operating System. 
    We're the software that turns operating model design into coordinated action.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="about-vision">
  <h2>The Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Every enterprise has an ERP for operations, a CRM for customers, and an 
    HCM for people. None of them have an execution system for strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    M Platform will be the operating system that turns strategic intent into 
    coordinated action—across every domain, for every company, at the speed 
    of disruption.
  </p>
  <p class="vision-statement">
    <strong>We're not building a better crisis tool. We're building the 
    central nervous system of the enterprise.</strong>

      <p>
        Marty brings a unique combination of elite sports coordination and 
        Fortune 500 transformation experience to M Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 5 years as a major college football coach—where 40-second 
        decisions are the norm—he spent 20+ years leading strategic execution 
        at Ford, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly, Charles Schwab, Boyd Gaming, 
        and Churchill Downs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently serving as Director of PMO at Churchill Downs Incorporated, 
        Marty built M Platform to answer the question that defined his career:

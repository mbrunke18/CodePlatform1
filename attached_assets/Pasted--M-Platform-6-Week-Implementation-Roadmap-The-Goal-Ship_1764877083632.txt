# M Platform: 6-Week Implementation Roadmap

## The Goal

Ship a complete, demonstrable product that shows the full PREPARE → MONITOR → EXECUTE → LEARN lifecycle with one real integration. This is what gets you funding conversations, not feature lists.

---

## Week 1: Foundation (4-Phase Schema + API)

### Objective
Get the database and API layer working for all 4 phases.

### Tasks

| Day | Task | Hours | Deliverable |
|-----|------|-------|-------------|
| Mon | Add schema to `/shared/schema.ts` | 2 | 6 new enums, 5 new tables |
| Mon | Run database migration | 1 | Tables created in PostgreSQL |
| Tue | Add PREPARE phase API routes | 3 | CRUD for `/prepare-items` |
| Tue | Add MONITOR phase API routes | 2 | CRUD for `/monitor-items` |
| Wed | Add LEARN phase API routes | 2 | CRUD for `/learn-items` |
| Wed | Add readiness score calculation | 2 | `/readiness` endpoint working |
| Thu | Test all endpoints with Postman/curl | 2 | All 15 endpoints verified |
| Thu | Seed sample data for 3 playbooks | 2 | Playbooks 1, 6, 12 have phase data |
| Fri | Bug fixes and edge cases | 4 | Stable API |

### Definition of Done
- `GET /api/playbook-library/[id]/readiness` returns calculated score
- `POST /api/playbook-library/[id]/prepare-items` creates items
- All CRUD operations work for all 3 new phase tables

### Code to Deploy
Use the implementation file I already created: `M-4Phase-Implementation-For-Replit.md` Parts 1-3

## What's NOT in This Roadmap

Explicitly deferred to post-funding:

| Feature | Why Deferred |
|---------|--------------|
| AI Pattern Recognition | Requires ML infrastructure, real data |
| Weak Signal Visualization | Needs actual signal sources |
| Multi-integration dashboard | One working integration > dashboard of none |
| Competitive benchmarking | Requires customer data you don't have |
| ServiceNow integration | Jira proves the pattern first |
| Slack/Teams notifications | Can add quickly once core works |
| Role-based views | One good view > many partial views |

---

- Work through week by week
- Test each week's deliverables before moving on

### For Human Developer

## Final Note

This roadmap gets you from "promising prototype" to "fundable product demo" in 6 weeks. It's aggressive but achievable.

The key insight: **You don't need more features. You need fewer features that work completely.**

The 4-phase lifecycle IS your product. Everything else is either proof it works (Jira integration) or packaging (mobile, demo scenarios).

Ship the loop. Then raise.

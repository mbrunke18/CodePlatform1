### FEATURE 2: Stakeholder Intelligence

**AI-Powered Role Assignment Based on Availability & Expertise**

```
INTELLIGENT STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Playbook #004 activates at 2:47 AM Saturday

PRIMARY ASSIGNMENTS (From Template):
├─ CEO: John Smith
├─ CTO: Sarah Chen
├─ CPO: Michael Brown
└─ ... (8 total Tier 1 stakeholders)

AI AVAILABILITY CHECK:
├─ John Smith (CEO): ✓ Available (phone detected in home location)
├─ Sarah Chen (CTO): ✗ UNAVAILABLE (International flight, airplane mode)
├─ Michael Brown (CPO): ✓ Available (phone active)
└─ ...

│  sufficient for initial assessment
│
├─ Alert sent to Tom with context: "Substituting for CTO per
│  succession plan. Sarah will be briefed upon landing (8 hours)"
│
└─ Sarah Chen added to "deferred notification" list
   (Will receive full briefing when available)

For Playbook #064 (Data Breach), AI prioritizes:
├─ Security expertise: CISO (required)
├─ Legal expertise: Privacy counsel (required)
├─ Technical expertise: CTO or senior engineering (required)
├─ Crisis management: CEO or COO (required)
└─ Communications: CCO (required)

If any required expertise unavailable:
├─ Activate external resources (pre-contracted consultants)
├─ Delay decision checkpoints until expert available
└─ Flag for CEO: "Proceeding with reduced capability"

DRILL SETUP: Playbook #004 (Competitor Breakthrough)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MODE: [SIMULATION] 🟢
All participants notified: THIS IS A DRILL

SCENARIO GENERATOR:
AI creates realistic crisis:
├─ Competitor: [GENERATED: "NeuralTech Inc."]
├─ Announcement: [GENERATED: "10x faster AI inference, 1/3 cost"]
├─ Media Coverage: [SIMULATED: 1,247 articles, 89% positive]
├─ Customer Inquiries: [SIMULATED: 23 customers asking questions]
└─ Threat Score: [CALCULATED: 87/100]

DRILL OBJECTIVES:
✓ Test war room assembly speed (target: <3 minutes)
✓ Verify decision tree clarity (can team reach decision?)
✓ Validate communication templates (do they work?)
✓ Identify bottlenecks (where does execution slow down?)

DRILL EXECUTION:
├─ T+0:00: Trigger fires (drill notification sent)
├─ T+2:47: War room assembled (7/8 participants) ⚠️
│  Missing: CFO (calendar conflict not cleared)
├─ T+5:23: Decision reached (Option B selected)
├─ T+8:45: Communications drafted (2 templates needed edits)
├─ T+11:30: Drill complete
└─ Total Time: 11 min 30 sec ✓ (Target: 12 min)

PERFORMANCE SCORECARD:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
War Room Assembly:     ████████░░  87% (1 missing, 2:47 vs 3:00)
Decision Speed:        ████████░░  88% (5:23 vs 6:00 target)
Communication Quality: ███████░░░  76% (needed edits)
Overall Readiness:     ████████░░  83% (GOOD)

IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
🔴 CRITICAL: CFO calendar auto-clear not working
   Fix: Update CFO's EA with drill calendar integration

🟡 MODERATE: Communication templates need refinement
   • Media statement: Add technical comparison section
   • Customer email: Clarify product roadmap timeline

🟢 MINOR: One stakeholder joined late
   • Tom (VP Sales) joined at T+3:15 (meeting overrun)
   • Recommendation: Buffer time for travel between meetings

NEXT DRILL SCHEDULED: 90 days
PLAYBOOK UPDATED: Yes (2 modifications based on findings)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Companies that achieved 98% retention did these 3 things:

   top performers notified customers immediately. Result:
   34% higher customer satisfaction scores.

2. EXECUTIVE PERSONAL CALLS TO TOP 50 ACCOUNTS

   Extended monitoring increased customer perception of
   "company cares" by 47% and cost only $127/customer vs.

### Option A: Response Time Focus
```
72 hours → 12 minutes

That's how long it takes most organizations to coordinate 
strategic response — and how fast M makes it happen.

[McKinsey's crisis framework focuses on the first 72 hours. 
We built a system that compresses it to minutes.]
```

### Option B: Market Problem Focus
```
91% of organizations have faced major disruption.
Most took days to respond.

M changes that.

### Option C: Cost Focus
```
$4.88 million

The average cost of a single incident.

```
The 72-Hour Gap
```

### Body Copy
```
When strategic disruptions hit — competitor moves, cyber incidents, 
regulatory changes, executive departures — most organizations scramble.

Not because they lack talent. Because they lack a system.

# The Research Behind M

M was built on a foundation of industry research and 
20+ years of Fortune 500 operational experience.

## The Problem is Well-Documented

### Response Time
McKinsey's crisis response framework focuses on "the first 72 hours" 
as the critical window for organizational response. Most companies 
struggle to get aligned within this timeframe.

M compresses coordinated response to under 15 minutes.

### Disruption is Constant
PwC's 2023 Global Crisis Survey found that 91% of organizations 
have experienced at least one major disruption beyond the pandemic, 
with companies averaging 3.5 significant disruptions every two years.

M ensures you're ready for the next one.

### Speed Saves Money
IBM's 2024 Cost of Data Breach study proves what we've seen 
in practice: faster response = lower costs.

- $1.76M saved by containing incidents within 30 days
- 35% cost reduction with pre-defined response teams
- $2.2M saved per incident with automation
- 98 days faster response with AI-powered tools

M provides all of these capabilities in a single platform.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Design Recommendations

1. **Large Numbers** — Statistics should be visually prominent (large font, contrasting color)

2. **Source Attribution** — Always include source, but make it subtle (smaller font, lighter color)

3. **Animation** — Consider counting-up animation for numbers on scroll

4. **Icons** — Use simple icons next to each stat (clock for time, dollar for cost, etc.)

5. **Contrast** — Statistics sections should have distinct background color to stand out

### SEO Considerations

- Include statistics in meta descriptions
- Create alt text for any stat graphics
- Consider a /research page for long-tail "crisis response statistics" searches

### Mobile Optimization

- Stack statistics vertically on mobile
- Ensure source text is readable (min 12px)
- Large numbers should remain prominent

The average organization takes 72 hours to coordinate strategic 
response to major disruptions. According to IBM, that delay costs 
$1.76 million in additional damages per incident.

M changes the math. Our pre-staged playbooks, automated orchestration, 
and continuous monitoring compress response time from days to minutes — 
protecting your organization and your bottom line.

## WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Don't claim statistics as your own research
❌ Don't modify the numbers
❌ Don't use logos without checking usage rights
❌ Don't bury sources — make them findable
❌ Don't overload pages with too many stats (pick 3-4 per section max)

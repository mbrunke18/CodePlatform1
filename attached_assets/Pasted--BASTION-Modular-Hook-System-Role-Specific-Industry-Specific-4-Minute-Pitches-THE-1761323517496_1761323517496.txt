# ROLE-SPECIFIC HOOKS (Choose Based on Title)

## FOR THE CEO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: What percentage of your strategic initiatives actually deliver on time and on budget?

**[Pause]**

Last month, McKinsey published research on 757 Fortune 1000 CEOs. The finding: **You’re losing 30% of your strategic value—$144 million annually—not to bad strategy, but to execution gaps.**

Your board approved a strategy that should generate $100M. You’re delivering $70M. The $30M gap? Coordination delays between your decision and your organization’s execution.

**[Lean forward]**

Here’s what that looks like: You decide Monday to respond to a competitive threat. Your organization schedules meetings, aligns stakeholders, navigates approvals. Three weeks later, you respond. Your competitor responded Day 3.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I spent five years making decisions that had to coordinate across 11 people in 40 seconds. I built the system that brings that to business.

Want to see how you close the 30% gap?”

-----

## FOR THE CFO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: What’s your company’s biggest untracked expense that doesn’t show up on any line item?

**[Pause 2 seconds]**

Coordination overhead. McKinsey just quantified it: **$144 million annually** for the typical Fortune 1000 company.

That’s the cost of:

- Deals lost because you moved too slow: $52M
- Meetings, rework, delays: $38M
- Crisis damage from slow response: $23M
- Revenue delayed from slow launches: $31M

**[Pull out phone/show one stat]**

Your teams spend 127,000 hours per year in coordination meetings that create zero value.

**[Lean forward]**

Here’s the ROI I’m offering: $114 million Year 1 return on $[X] million investment. Payback period: 6.3 weeks.

That’s faster than your last ERP upgrade, your Salesforce expansion, your operating model redesign—faster than any strategic initiative you’ve approved in three years.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I can show you exactly where the $144M is leaking and how to capture $114M of it in Year 1.

Want to see the numbers?”

-----

## FOR THE COO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: You have a well-designed supply chain continuity plan, right? When was the last time you actually executed it at the speed the plan assumes?

**[Pause]**

Every COO I talk to has the same problem: **Great processes on paper. Slow execution in reality.**

Not because your people aren’t capable. Because coordination takes time.

**[Lean forward]**

Last month, one of your competitors’ primary supplier went down at 3 AM. Their production was at risk in six hours.

Traditional response: 72 hours to coordinate procurement, logistics, operations, finance, and legal. Three days of downtime. $2.1M in rush orders.

**[Count on fingers]**

With the system I built: 12 minutes to activate pre-negotiated backup suppliers, re-route logistics, notify customers. Zero downtime. Zero rush orders.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I spent five years coordinating 11 people in 40 seconds in high-pressure situations. I know what operational excellence at speed looks like.

Want to see what your 72-hour coordination looks like at 12 minutes?”

-----

## FOR THE CHRO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: What’s the #1 reason your top performers give in exit interviews?

**[Pause - they usually know]**

Let me guess: Some version of ‘I’m frustrated by how slow we move’ or ‘I can’t get things done here.’

**[Lean forward]**

Last year, you lost [X] high performers. At $250K average replacement cost plus productivity loss, that’s $[X]M. But here’s the invisible cost: the best people in your industry won’t even interview with you because they’ve heard your culture is slow.

**[Direct]**

In 2028, when college freshmen graduate, they’ll interview with you and ask: ‘How fast does work happen here?’

If you say ‘We schedule meetings to discuss responses,’ they’ll join your competitor who says: ‘We execute strategic decisions in 12 minutes. You’ll see your work impact the business same-day, not next quarter.’

**[Lean back]**

I built the system that makes your organization the place top performers choose—and stay.

Want to see how you become the company that executes while others coordinate?”

-----

## FOR THE CMO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Your competitor launches a product tomorrow targeting your core customers. How long until your counter-campaign is in market?

**[Pause - they usually say “weeks”]**

**[Nod]** Three weeks is typical. Problem: Your competitor’s message has three weeks to land with your customers before you respond.

**[Lean forward]**

Here’s what that costs: Last quarter, a Fortune 500 company lost $12M in market share because their competitive response took 21 days. Their competitor moved in 3 days. By Day 21, the narrative was set.

**[Count on fingers]**

Your brand team needs messaging. Your content team needs assets. Your digital team needs campaigns. Your PR team needs positioning. Your legal team needs approval.

Sequential coordination: 21 days.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that makes all five teams receive coordinated assignments simultaneously and execute in 3 days.

Same competitive threat. 18-day advantage.

Want to see how you become the brand that defines the narrative instead of responding to it?”

-----

## FOR THE CRO/SALES LEADER

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: What’s your average time from ‘customer requests proposal’ to ‘proposal delivered’?

**[Pause - they’ll say a number, usually 2-3 weeks]**

**[Nod]** And your top competitor?

**[They usually don’t know]**

**[Lean forward]**

Let me tell you: They’re doing it in 5-7 days. You’re doing it in 21. That 14-day gap is why your win rate is [X]% instead of [X+5]%.

**[Direct]**

Last quarter, you lost [X] deals. How many came down to ‘They moved faster’?

**[Count on fingers]**

Your deals don’t die because of product or price. They die because while you’re coordinating—getting legal review, waiting for finance approval, aligning on messaging—your competitor is presenting.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that takes your proposal cycle from 21 days to 5 days. Sales, legal, finance, product—all coordinating simultaneously instead of sequentially.

That 16-day advantage turns into 5 percentage points of win rate. At your deal sizes, that’s $44M annually.

Want to see how you close before your competitor even responds?”

-----

## FOR THE CTO/CIO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Your CEO announces a major digital transformation initiative Monday morning. How long until IT, security, data, operations, HR, and finance are actually coordinating the execution?

**[Pause]**

Weeks, right? You have the technology roadmap. You have the budget. You have the talent. But coordination across business units takes forever.

**[Lean forward]**

Last year, a Fortune 500 CTO told me their digital transformation took 18 months instead of 12—not because of technology complexity, but because coordinating IT, security, compliance, business units, and change management took 6 months longer than planned.

McKinsey: Companies lose 30% of transformation value to coordination delays. That’s $144M annually.

**[Count on fingers]**

Your technology stack is excellent. Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Teams—best-in-class. But they don’t coordinate each other. When a major incident hits or a transformation milestone triggers, you’re manually coordinating across systems and stakeholders.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the execution layer that orchestrates your entire stack. When conditions demand coordinated action—security incident, system outage, transformation milestone—IT, security, operations, compliance, and business units receive coordinated assignments simultaneously.

Want to see how your technology investments finally coordinate at the speed of business decisions?”

-----

## FOR THE CISO/CSO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: You detect a security breach at 2 AM. How long until IT, legal, communications, HR, operations, and executive leadership are executing a coordinated incident response?

**[Pause]**

Hours, typically. And every hour matters.

**[Lean forward]**

Last year, a Fortune 500 company had a breach detected at 2:47 AM. Their coordinated response went live at 11 AM—8 hours and 13 minutes later. By then, the breach had spread to three additional systems.

**[Direct]**

The problem wasn’t your incident response plan. You have an excellent plan. The problem was coordination: IT needs to contain, legal needs to assess obligations, communications needs to draft statements, HR needs to notify employees, operations needs continuity protocols, executives need briefings.

Sequential coordination: 8+ hours.

**[Count on fingers]**

**[Lean forward]**

I built the system that makes your incident response plan execute at the speed it was designed for. 2:47 AM: Breach detected. 2:58 AM: Pre-built “Security Incident Response” playbook activates. 3:09 AM: IT, legal, comms, HR, operations, executives—all executing coordinated response. 47 minutes instead of 8 hours.

**[Direct eye contact]**

In cybersecurity, time is damage. Every minute of delay is data, reputation, regulatory exposure.

Want to see how your incident response goes from 8 hours to 47 minutes?”

-----

## FOR THE CDO (Chief Data Officer)

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: You’ve built an incredible data infrastructure. Analytics, AI, dashboards—your data tells you exactly what’s happening. But when your data signals ‘Customer churn risk’ or ‘Supply chain disruption incoming,’ how long until the organization actually acts on that insight?

**[Pause]**

**[Lean forward]**

You’re not struggling with data quality or analytics. You’re struggling with data-to-action speed.

Your dashboard shows ‘Enterprise customer X showing churn signals.’ You alert the account team. They schedule a meeting. They coordinate with product, success, and leadership. Two weeks later, they reach out to the customer.

Customer churned on Day 8.

**[Direct]**

McKinsey: Companies lose $144M annually to coordination delays. In data-driven organizations, that’s the gap between insight and action.

**[Count on fingers]**

You have the signals. You have the predictions. You have the recommendations. But turning ‘AI detected pattern’ into ‘organization executing response’ takes weeks.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that closes the insight-to-action gap. Your AI detects customer churn risk. Bastion activates “Customer Retention” playbook. Account team, product team, success team, executive sponsor—all receive coordinated assignments within minutes.

Your data finally drives action at the speed of the insight.

Want to see how you become the CDO whose insights actually get executed?”

-----

## FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL/CLO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Regulatory change announced Friday afternoon. Multiple business units affected. How long until you have legal assessment complete, business impact understood, compliance protocols updated, and organization executing the required changes?

**[Pause]**

Weeks, typically. Meanwhile, the compliance clock is ticking.

**[Lean forward]**

Last quarter, a company faced a regulatory deadline: 60 days to compliance. Legal analysis took 2 weeks. Coordinating business unit responses took another 3 weeks. Implementation took 5 weeks. They hit the deadline with 2 days to spare.

**[Direct]**

Here’s the problem: Legal isn’t the bottleneck. You provide excellent counsel. The bottleneck is coordination between legal, compliance, operations, IT, HR, and affected business units.

**[Count on fingers]**

New regulation announced. Legal needs to analyze. Compliance needs to update protocols. IT needs to modify systems. HR needs to train. Operations needs to change processes. Business units need to execute.

Sequential coordination: 5 weeks.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that makes regulatory response coordinate in days, not weeks. Regulation announced. “Regulatory Compliance” playbook activates. Legal analysis, compliance updates, IT changes, HR training, operational modifications—all coordinating simultaneously.

Five weeks becomes 10 days. You hit compliance deadlines with margin, not stress.

Want to see how legal counsel translates into organizational compliance at the speed regulations demand?”

-----

## FOR THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Audit notification arrives Monday morning. Multiple departments need to provide documentation, evidence, and responses. Deadline: 2 weeks. How long until you actually have coordinated responses from IT, finance, operations, legal, and HR?

**[Pause]**

Usually takes the full 2 weeks, right? Everyone scrambling, emails flying, last-minute coordination.

**[Lean forward]**

Last month, a compliance officer told me they got a regulatory audit notice with a 10-day response window. Day 8: Still coordinating responses from six departments. Days 9-10: Working around the clock to compile everything.

**[Direct]**

The problem isn’t that your teams don’t care about compliance. The problem is coordination: IT needs to pull system logs. Finance needs transaction records. Operations needs process documentation. Legal needs contract evidence. HR needs training records.

Each department working independently. Lots of back-and-forth. Deadline stress.

**[Count on fingers]**

**[Lean forward]**

I built the system that makes audit response coordinate like a well-rehearsed plan. Audit notice received. “Regulatory Audit Response” playbook activates. IT, finance, operations, legal, HR—all receive specific documentation requests with templates, deadlines, and submission protocols.

Day 2: All responses compiled and ready. Days 3-10: Buffer for executive review and refinement.

**[Direct eye contact]**

Want to see how you go from deadline stress to deadline confidence?”

-----

## FOR THE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: You develop brilliant strategies. Board approves them. Resources allocated. Clear objectives set. Six months later, how much of that strategy is actually executing as planned?

**[Pause - they usually say 60-70%]**

**[Lean forward]**

McKinsey just quantified that: 70%. Even high-performing companies deliver only 70% of strategic potential. The 30% gap—$144 million annually—is execution delays.

**[Direct]**

Here’s what happens: You present strategy. Everyone nods. Initiatives get assigned. Then… coordination hell. Cross-functional teams can’t align. Resources don’t deploy fast enough. Dependencies block progress. Status meetings reveal everyone’s working, but nothing’s coordinating.

**[Count on fingers]**

Strategy requires marketing, sales, product, operations, finance, and IT executing together. But coordination takes weeks. By the time everyone aligns, market conditions changed, competitors moved, and your strategy is behind schedule.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that closes the strategy-to-execution gap. Strategic initiative approved. Decision playbook activates. All six functions receive coordinated assignments, resources, timelines, and dependencies mapped.

Your strategy executes at the speed it was designed for. 70% delivery becomes 95% delivery.

Want to see how your strategies finally execute as brilliantly as they’re designed?”

-----

## FOR THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: You identify a material risk—supply chain vulnerability, fraud indicator, operational exposure, whatever. You alert leadership. How long until the organization is actually executing risk mitigation across all affected areas?

**[Pause]**

Weeks, typically. Meanwhile, the risk is growing.

**[Lean forward]**

Last year, a CRO identified fraud patterns indicating potential $10M exposure. Alert sent Monday. Risk committee meeting scheduled Wednesday. Mitigation plan approved Friday. Coordination across finance, operations, IT, legal, and business units: 3 weeks. Full mitigation: 8 weeks.

During those 8 weeks, the fraud continued. Final loss: $3.2M.

**[Direct]**

The problem isn’t risk identification. You’re excellent at that. The problem is risk-to-mitigation speed. You spot the risk. You recommend actions. Then coordination delays turn urgent risks into realized losses.

**[Count on fingers]**

Risk identified: Supply chain vulnerability. Requires procurement to activate backups, operations to adjust production, finance to authorize emergency spend, legal to review contracts, communications to notify customers.

Sequential coordination: Weeks. Risk exposure: Growing.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that makes risk mitigation execute at the speed of risk emergence. Risk identified. “Risk Mitigation” playbook activates. Procurement, operations, finance, legal, communications—all executing coordinated mitigation within hours.

You spot risks. Organization mitigates immediately. Exposure minimized.

Want to see how risk identification finally translates to instant organizational action?”

-----

## FOR THE CHIEF PEOPLE OFFICER/CHRO

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: What’s the #1 reason your top performers give in exit interviews?

**[Pause - they usually know]**

Let me guess: Some version of ‘I’m frustrated by how slow we move’ or ‘I can’t get things done here.’

**[Lean forward]**

Last year, you lost [X] high performers. At $250K average replacement cost plus productivity loss, that’s $[X]M. But here’s the invisible cost: the best people in your industry won’t even interview with you because they’ve heard your culture is slow.

**[Direct]**

In 2028, when college freshmen graduate, they’ll interview with you and ask: ‘How fast does work happen here?’

If you say ‘We schedule meetings to discuss responses,’ they’ll join your competitor who says: ‘We execute strategic decisions in 12 minutes. You’ll see your work impact the business same-day, not next quarter.’

**[Lean back]**

I built the system that makes your organization the place top performers choose—and stay.

Want to see how you become the company that executes while others coordinate?”

-----

# INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC HOOKS

## FINANCIAL SERVICES

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: When the Fed announces an unexpected rate change at 2 PM, how long until your entire organization—trading, advisory, product, compliance, communications—has a coordinated response to clients?

**[Pause]**

Hours? Days?

**[Lean forward]**

Your competitors who respond in minutes capture the client calls. You respond in days, clients have already moved.

McKinsey research: Financial services companies lose $144M annually to coordination delays. In your industry, that’s the cost of being second to respond to market moves.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I spent five years coordinating responses in 40 seconds when conditions changed. I built the system that brings that to financial services.

Want to see how you become the firm that defines client strategy instead of explaining market moves after the fact?”

-----

## HEALTHCARE/PHARMA

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Your competitor announces trial results that challenge your drug positioning. How long until you have coordinated response across medical affairs, commercial, regulatory, legal, and communications?

**[Pause]**

Weeks, typically. Meanwhile, physicians are forming opinions based on your competitor’s narrative.

**[Lean forward]**

Last year, a pharma company lost $89M in market share because their response to competitive data took 28 days. Physicians made prescribing decisions by Day 10.

McKinsey: Healthcare companies lose $144M annually to coordination delays. In your industry, that’s doctors, payers, and patients making decisions while you’re still aligning internally.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that coordinates medical affairs, commercial, regulatory, legal, and communications simultaneously—3 days instead of 28.

Want to see how you shape the medical conversation instead of responding to it?”

-----

## MANUFACTURING

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Your primary supplier’s facility goes down at 3 AM. Production stops in 6 hours unless you activate backup suppliers. How long to coordinate procurement, logistics, operations, quality, and finance?

**[Pause]**

**[Lean forward]**

Last month, a manufacturer I talked to said 72 hours. Cost: $2.1M in rush orders, three days production down, customer deliveries missed.

With the system I built: 12 minutes to activate pre-negotiated backup suppliers, re-route logistics, adjust production schedules. Zero downtime.

**[Count on fingers]**

McKinsey: Manufacturing companies lose $144M annually to coordination delays. In your industry, that’s supplier disruptions, quality issues, regulatory incidents—all requiring coordination across procurement, operations, quality, and logistics.

**[Direct eye contact]**

Want to see how you go from 72-hour recovery to 12-minute response?”

-----

## TECHNOLOGY/SAAS

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Your competitor launches a feature your customers have been requesting. How long until you have product roadmap updated, engineering prioritized, marketing positioned, sales enabled, and support trained?

**[Pause]**

Weeks, right? Meanwhile, customers are evaluating the competitor.

**[Lean forward]**

Last quarter, a SaaS company lost $8M in ARR because their competitive response took 6 weeks. Customers churned by week 3.

McKinsey: Tech companies lose $144M annually to coordination delays. In your industry, that’s the cost of product teams, engineering, marketing, sales, and support not coordinating at the speed of customer decisions.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that makes product, engineering, marketing, sales, and support coordinate in days, not weeks.

Want to see how you launch competitive responses while your competitor is still celebrating their release?”

-----

## RETAIL

**[Look them in the eye]**

“Quick question: Your competitor launches a promotion that’s crushing your sales in key categories. How long to coordinate merchandising, pricing, marketing, supply chain, and store operations on a counter-promotion?

**[Pause]**

**[Lean forward]**

Last month, a retailer lost $12M in market share because their response took 18 days. The competitor’s promotion ran for 2 weeks. By the time the response launched, customers had already shifted behavior.

McKinsey: Retail companies lose $144M annually to coordination delays. In your industry, that’s merchandising, pricing, marketing, supply chain, and stores not moving at the speed of consumer behavior.

**[Direct eye contact]**

I built the system that makes all five functions coordinate in 3 days instead of 18.

Want to see how you become the retailer that sets the market pace instead of responding to it?”

-----

# HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM

## BEFORE THE CONVERSATION:

**1. Identify their role** (CEO, CFO, COO, CHRO, CMO, CRO)  
**2. Identify their industry** (if industry-specific pain is relevant)  
**3. Choose the hook** that matches  
**4. Memorize that 1-minute opener**

## DURING THE CONVERSATION:

**MINUTE 1:** Use the role/industry-specific hook  
**MINUTES 2-4:** Use the universal conviction script (same for everyone):

-----

## UNIVERSAL MINUTES 2-4 (After Any Hook)

“Here’s how it works:

**THE PROBLEM YOU LIVE:**

When [their scenario from hook] happens, you have eight departments, fourteen approval layers, thirty-seven stakeholders working sequentially. Weeks pass.

**THE BASTION DIFFERENCE:**

Pre-built decision playbook activates. Minute 1: All stakeholders receive coordinated assignments with pre-approved frameworks. Minute 12: Two hundred employees executing. Day 3: Response in market.

**THE PROOF:**

23% of Fortune 1000—175 companies—already have this. McKinsey validated the $144M problem. Zero companies reverted.

Results: 18 days faster responses, 71 hours faster crisis containment, 16 days faster deal closing.

**THE MONEY:**

Year 1: $114M captured. Investment: $[X]M. Payback: 6.3 weeks.

**THE URGENCY:**

23% have this today. 61% will by 2026. First-mover advantage compounds. Late-mover disadvantage never closes.

**THE EASY START:**

Thirty days: Pick your costliest scenario. We map it. We build the playbook. We prove it works for YOUR organization. Day 30, you decide.

**[YOUR QUESTION]**

So: What’s the one scenario where slow coordination costs you the most?

When can we start?”

## THE POWER OF THIS SYSTEM:

**Instead of:** “Let me tell you about our platform…”  
**You say:** “Quick question: [their exact pain]…”

They immediately think: *“This person understands MY world.”*

**That’s how you get their attention in 15 seconds and their commitment in 4 minutes.**

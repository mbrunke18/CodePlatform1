## ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

"The 2025 Business Agility Report shows organizations taking nearly 4 years to see just 10% improvement in agility—while those that do improve see 10.3% revenue per employee growth. M Platform compresses that timeline from years to quarters with 148 pre-built execution playbooks. We transform strategic response from 72 hours to 12 minutes."

## THREE STATS TO MEMORIZE

| Stat | Number | Your Claim |
|------|--------|------------|
| Time to 10% improvement | 3.8 years (industry) | "Quarters with M Platform" |
| Revenue growth (improving orgs) | 10.3% | "Proven financial impact" |
| Governance supporting agility | Only 22% | "We close that gap" |

### Post 1: The Problem
```
The 2025 Business Agility Report just dropped some sobering numbers:

→ 3.8 years to see 10% improvement in agility
→ Only 22% have governance that supports speed
→ 58% restructured last year

The organizations that DID improve? 10.3% revenue per employee growth.

The ones that didn't? 3.5%.

That gap is the difference between thriving and surviving.

(Working on something that compresses that 3.8-year timeline to quarters. More soon.)

### Post 2: The Solution Tease
```
"Pressure exposes cracks in the system."

That's the headline from the 2025 Business Agility Report.

But here's what I've learned from 20+ years of Fortune 500 transformation work:

The cracks were always there. Pressure just makes them visible.

The question isn't "how do we avoid pressure?"

It's "how do we build systems that perform UNDER pressure?"

That's why I built M Platform—148 pre-built playbooks that activate in 12 minutes, not 12 months.

Because the best time to prepare was yesterday. The second best time is now.

### Post 3: The Coaching Angle
```
In football, we never improvised on game day.

Every situation had a play. Every play had been practiced.

When the pressure hit, we didn't huddle to figure it out—we executed.

The 2025 Business Agility Report shows most organizations take 3.8 YEARS to improve their execution capability by just 10%.

That's not agility. That's hoping the game doesn't change before you're ready.

What if your organization had a playbook for every strategic situation—ready to activate in minutes?

That's what M Platform delivers.

## OBJECTION RESPONSES (memorize these)

**"We already have processes"**
> "Most organizations do. The BAI report shows the issue isn't having processes—it's activating them fast enough. The gap between knowing what to do and doing it quickly is where 78% of organizations are stuck."

**"We're mid-transformation"**
> "So are 58% of organizations according to the 2025 report. The question is whether you transform AND execute, or pause everything while you transform. M Platform lets you do both."

**"Show me the ROI"**
> "Organizations that improved their agility saw 10.3% revenue per employee growth. Those that declined? 3.5%. That's the BAI data across 244 organizations."

**"We're too regulated for speed"**
> "Financial services actually improved 11% in agility this year while staying compliant. The key isn't removing governance—it's embedding it into execution so it enables speed instead of blocking it."

## EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** 3.8 years for 10% improvement—there's a faster way

Hi [Name],

The 2025 Business Agility Report just revealed that organizations are taking nearly 4 years to see just 10% improvement in business agility.

But here's what caught my attention: organizations that DID improve saw 10.3% revenue per employee growth. Those that didn't? Just 3.5%.

Given [Company]'s position in [industry], I thought you'd want to know about M Platform—a Strategic Execution Operating System that compresses that improvement timeline from years to quarters.

148 pre-built playbooks. 12-minute activation. Built on 20+ years of Fortune 500 transformation experience.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS

1. "How long does it typically take your organization to mount a coordinated response to an unexpected event?"

2. "When was the last time a governance process blocked something time-sensitive?"

3. "If I told you the average organization takes 3.8 years to improve agility by 10%, where would you estimate you fall?"

4. "Organizations that improved agility saw 10.3% revenue per employee growth. What would that mean for your business?"

Based on everything I know about M, your positioning, and where the product currently stands, here are my recommendations for next steps before the roadshow.

---

## Priority Framework

I'm organizing this around **what will move investors** and **what will close customers**. Roadshows are about creating urgency and credibility. You need:

1. **Proof the product works** (demos that don't break)
2. **Proof the market exists** (validated claims, customer signals)
3. **Proof you're the one to build it** (founder story, methodology credibility)

You already have #3 nailed with the OurStory page. Let's focus on #1 and #2.

## Top 5 Priorities Before Roadshow

### 1. Lock Down the Demo Experience

**Why it matters:** Investors will watch you demo. If anything breaks, stutters, or confuses, you lose credibility. The demo IS the product at this stage.

**Specific actions:**

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Audit demo paths** | Walk through `/demo/live-activation`, `/executive-simulation`, and at least 2 industry demos end-to-end. Document any bugs. |
| **Add demo completion screen** | After demo ends, show: response time achieved, comparison to 72-hour baseline, clear CTA (Schedule Call / Request Access) |
| **Create "Investor Demo" preset** | A locked, predictable demo path that you control. No randomness, no edge cases. Same data every time. |
| **Practice 3-minute pitch demo** | You should be able to show the core value (signal detection → playbook activation → task deployment → time saved) in under 3 minutes cold. |

**Deliverable:** A bulletproof 3-minute demo you can run on any device, any time, without internet hiccups affecting the experience.

### 2. Validate and Source Your Statistics

**Why it matters:** Sophisticated investors will challenge your numbers. You need to either cite sources or clearly label proprietary research.

**Current gaps:**

| Claim | Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "148 playbooks" | Need to verify actual count | Audit database or PlaybookLibrary component |
| "92 intelligence signals" vs "12 intelligence sources" | Inconsistent across pages | Pick one and standardize |
| "$144M Annual Value Gap" | No source | Either cite source OR reframe as "Based on our analysis of Fortune 500 strategic delays" |
| "10,000x Speed Difference" | Sounds hyperbolic | Consider "100x faster" or "orders of magnitude" |
| "12 minutes" | Need to demonstrate this is achievable | Time your actual demo; adjust claim if needed |

**Deliverable:** One-page "Claims Validation" document you can hand to investors if challenged. Shows your work.

I already created `/mnt/user-data/outputs/M-Validated-Statistics-QuickRef.md` in our earlier session — review and update it.

### 3. Create a Customer-Ready Pilot Framework

**Why it matters:** Investors want to know your go-to-market. "We're talking to customers" is weak. "We have 3 pilots launching in Q1 with defined success criteria" is strong.

**What you need:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pilot structure** | 90-day engagement, 3 phases (Setup, Activation, Measurement) |
| **Success metrics** | Response time reduction (target: 80%), playbook activation rate, user adoption |
| **Pricing for pilots** | Discounted pilot rate ($50K-$100K) with conversion to full contract |
| **Ideal customer profile** | Fortune 1000, specific verticals (Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing first) |
| **Entry point** | CSO, CRO, or Head of Strategy — not IT |

**Deliverable:** One-page "Pilot Program Overview" you can leave with prospects. Shows you're ready to deploy, not just demo.

### 4. Build the "Why Now" Narrative

**Why it matters:** Investors need to believe the timing is right. M needs a forcing function — why is 2025 the year this becomes urgent?

**Potential "Why Now" angles:**

| Angle | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **AI maturity** | LLMs now capable of real-time signal analysis; wasn't possible 2 years ago |
| **Increased disruption frequency** | PwC 2023: 91% of orgs faced major disruption; average 3.5 per 2 years |
| **Post-COVID executive awareness** | Leaders now understand "black swan" events aren't rare |
| **Competitor response windows shrinking** | Digital-native competitors move in days, not quarters |
| **Regulatory pressure** | SEC, EU regulations require faster disclosure and response |

**Deliverable:** 2-3 slides in your investor deck that answer "Why is this the moment?" with hard data.

### 5. Prepare Your Competitive Moat Answers

**Why it matters:** "Why can't Salesforce/ServiceNow/Microsoft build this?" is coming. You need a crisp answer.

**Your moat arguments:**

| Moat | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Domain expertise** | 20+ years Fortune 500 strategic execution + 5 years coaching methodology. This isn't a feature; it's an operating system. Generalists can't replicate the playbook depth. |
| **148 pre-built playbooks** | 2+ years of content development. Competitors would need to build from scratch. |
| **Category creation** | SEOS doesn't exist yet. First mover defines the category. ServiceNow is IT workflows; Salesforce is CRM; M is strategic execution. Different buyer, different budget. |
| **Speed to value** | Enterprise platforms take 12-18 months to deploy. M targets 6-week activation. |

**Deliverable:** Practice answering "Why can't [BigCo] just add this?" in 60 seconds.

## Secondary Priorities (If Time Permits)

### 6. Mobile Polish
Test the full experience on iPhone and Android. Executives often browse on phones. Fix any responsive issues.

### 7. Customer Testimonial Strategy
You may not have testimonials yet, but prepare the framework. Who are your first 3 design partners? Can you get quotes from advisors or early reviewers?

### 8. Investor FAQ Document
Anticipate the 20 most likely questions and write crisp answers. Practice delivering them.

Looking at Bastion's current capabilities versus what Fortune 1000 executives actually struggle with, here are the only additions I'd make—and only if they solve a genuine pain point:

1. Decision Confidence Score (High Value)
The Problem: Executives hesitate not from lack of data, but from lack of conviction. "Do I have enough information to pull the trigger?"

The Solution:

Real-time confidence meter for each playbook execution
Shows: Data completeness (80%), Stakeholder alignment (92%), Historical precedent (3 similar scenarios), Risk coverage (95%)
Answers: "Is it safe to activate this playbook NOW?"
Why It Matters: Removes the "should I wait for more data?" paralysis. Executives activate faster.

2. Live Stakeholder Alignment Dashboard (High Value)
The Problem: "I activated the playbook, but I don't know if Legal has seen it yet, or if Finance approved their piece."

The Solution:

Real-time view of which stakeholders have acknowledged their role
Shows: "7/9 executives have reviewed" with names and timestamps
Live task completion by department
Why It Matters: The 12-minute execution time only works if everyone's coordinated. This removes "Did they get the message?" uncertainty.

3. Post-Execution Validation Report (Medium-High Value)
The Problem: "We executed the playbook. Did it actually work? What would we change?"

The Solution:

Automated post-mortem 48 hours after playbook completion
Compares predicted outcomes vs. actual outcomes
Feeds directly into Institutional Memory
Shows ROI of the playbook execution
Why It Matters: Builds trust in the platform. "The last 3 times we used this playbook, we hit our targets within 5%."

What I Would NOT Add
❌ More AI modules - You have enough (Pulse, Flux, Prism, Echo, Nova)
❌ More dashboards - Executives are drowning in dashboards
❌ More integrations - Integration Hub covers it
❌ More analytics - Analytics don't drive decisions; conviction does

Bottom Line
The platform is 95% complete. The only gaps are around decision confidence and execution visibility. Everything else would be feature bloat that dilutes the core value proposition: "Execute critical decisions in 12 minutes with complete confidence."

Would any of these three additions solve a problem you're hearing from potential customers?

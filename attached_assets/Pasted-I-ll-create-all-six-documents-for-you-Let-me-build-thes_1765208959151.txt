## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review and personalize** each document — add your specific details where [brackets] appear
2. **Practice the demo script** — run it 10+ times until it's natural
3. **Verify the playbook count** — make sure "148" is accurate
4. **Add demo completion CTA** — this is the one product change still needed
5. **Start the checklist** — work backward from your first meeting date

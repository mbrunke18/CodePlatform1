## Risk Mitigation

### What If Design Partners Don't Sign?
**Backup Plan**: Offer even more value
- Free forever for first 3 customers (not just 90 days)
- Dedicated implementation support (40 hours)
- Co-development: They help define the product

### What If Crisis Playbook Takes Longer Than 6 Weeks?
**Backup Plan**: Simplify ruthlessly
- Start with just Slack + Email integration (no Jira)
- Manual task tracking (no automation)
- Prove coordination value first, automate later

### What If No Crises Happen During Pilot?
**This is actually fine!**
- Simulations are sufficient to prove value
- "Preparedness" is the sell, not "response"
- Better positioning: "Hope for best, prepare for worst"

---

## Final Recommendation

### ✅ START WITH CRISIS MANAGEMENT

**Why**: Fastest path to 3 reference customers with quantified outcomes

**Timeline**: 90 days to references, 180 days to paying customers

**Investment Ask**: $1M to execute this plan (2 engineers, 1 product manager, you as CEO/sales)

**Success Metric**: 3 Fortune 500 references saying "Bastion reduced our crisis response time by 90%"

**Once you have that, everything else follows.**

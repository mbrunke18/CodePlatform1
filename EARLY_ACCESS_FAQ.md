## Success Metrics

### How do we measure ROI?

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- **Execution velocity:** Time from trigger to coordinated action (target: 12 minutes vs 72-hour baseline)
- **Window capture rate:** % of strategic opportunities executed within optimal timing
- **Stakeholder coordination time:** Hours saved per strategic initiative
- **Preparedness score:** % of strategic scenarios with ready-to-execute playbooks

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- Executive confidence in crisis response
- Cross-functional alignment quality
- Institutional learning captured
- Strategic agility improvement

### What ROI should we expect?

Based on VEXOR's design goals and industry execution benchmarks:

**Time Savings:** 60+ hours per strategic decision (72 hours → 12 minutes coordination)  
**Opportunity Capture:** 15-25% increase in execution windows captured  
**Cost Avoidance:** Reduced crisis response costs through preparation  
**Strategic Velocity:** 5-10x faster decision-to-execution cycle

*IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: These are projected values based on VEXOR's system design and published industry research (HBR "Why Strategy Execution Unravels" 2015, McKinsey "Decision Making in the Age of Urgency" 2023, Bain "The Execution Premium" 2022). VEXOR is in pre-launch with zero production customers. Actual results will vary significantly by organization, implementation quality, and scenario complexity. The 90-day pilot is designed to validate these projections in your specific context.*

# SLIDE 1: The $18M Problem

## Your Last Crisis Probably Looked Like This:

**Hour 1**: Something breaks  
- Security breach discovered  
- Product recall needed  
- Executive scandal breaks  
- PR disaster unfolds

**Hours 2-24**: Email Chaos  
- 100+ emails flying between Legal, PR, Executives  
- "Who's handling what?"  
- "Has anyone called the board?"  
- Duplicate work, missed tasks, confusion

**Hours 25-72**: Slow Coordination  
- Emergency meetings scheduled (calendars conflict)  
- War rooms assembled (people missing)  
- Tasks assigned (Slack, email, text - scattered)  
- Decisions delayed (can't find who approved what)

**Cost**: $18M in market cap, damaged reputation, executive stress

**Category**: Crisis Coordination Platform (expanding to all strategic scenarios)

**What We Do**: Transform crisis response from email chaos to orchestrated execution

**How It Works**: 4 Steps  
1. **PREPARE**: Build crisis playbooks (stakeholders, tasks, communications)  
2. **MONITOR**: AI watches for crisis signals 24/7  
3. **EXECUTE**: Auto-coordinate response (war room, tasks, dashboards)  
4. **LEARN**: Capture what worked for next time

**Technology**: AI-powered (GPT-4o) + Human-in-loop decision making

# SLIDE 4: Demo: Crisis Response Playbook

## Example: Data Breach Response

### Traditional Approach (72 hours)
- **Discovery**: IT finds breach at 2am Friday
- **Hour 0-12**: IT tries to reach CISO (weekend), sends emails
- **Hour 12-24**: CISO reaches CEO, starts calling Legal
- **Hour 24-48**: Saturday war room scheduled, 50% attendance
- **Hour 48-72**: Monday follow-up, customer notification delayed
- **Damage**: Breach reported in press before official statement

### Bastion Approach (4 hours)
- **Minute 1**: AI alerts CISO (anomaly detected)
- **Minute 5**: War room auto-created (CISO, CEO, Legal, PR, IT)
- **Minute 30**: Playbook activated (17 tasks assigned)
- **Hour 2**: Legal review complete, communication approved
- **Hour 4**: Customer notification sent, press release issued
- **Result**: Controlled narrative, trust maintained

# SLIDE 14: Competitive Landscape

## Why There's No Alternative Today

### Current "Solutions" (Fragmented)
❌ **Email + Slack**: Chaos, no structure, lost context  
❌ **Project Management Tools** (Asana, Monday): Not built for crisis speed  
❌ **Crisis Communications Firms**: Consultants, not software  
❌ **Incident Management** (PagerDuty): IT incidents, not business crises  
❌ **Enterprise Platforms** (Salesforce, ServiceNow): Not purpose-built for crisis coordination

### What's Missing (Bastion's Unique Value)
✅ **AI-Powered Monitoring**: 24/7 detection of crisis signals  
✅ **Pre-Built Playbooks**: Crisis scenarios ready to activate  
✅ **Instant Coordination**: Auto-create war rooms, notify stakeholders  
✅ **Institutional Memory**: Learn from every crisis, improve over time  
✅ **Executive Focus**: Built for C-suite decision velocity, not IT tickets

### Future Competition
- **Microsoft/Google/Salesforce**: Could build this, but they're focused on different markets  
- **Startups**: No one else is attacking "Executive Decision Operations" category  
- **Your Advantage**: As a design partner, you shape the product. First-mover advantage.

# SLIDE 17: Risk Mitigation

## Your Concerns (And Our Answers)

### Concern: "What if no crisis happens during the pilot?"
**Answer**: We simulate crises (tabletop exercises). You don't need a real crisis to prove value. Preparedness is the goal.

### Concern: "What if this doesn't work?"
**Answer**: You've invested zero dollars. Worst case: You get free crisis planning consulting. Best case: You're prepared for the next real crisis.

### Concern: "We already have processes for crisis management."
**Answer**: Great! We'll make them better. Most companies have processes, but execution is fragmented across email, Slack, meetings. We orchestrate what you already do.

### Concern: "Our IT/Security won't approve new software."
**Answer**: We work with your team. SOC 2 compliance in progress. Can operate in your existing tools (Slack, Email) without new systems.

### Concern: "We're too busy for a 90-day pilot."
**Answer**: We do the heavy lifting (40 hours of our time). Your investment: 4-6 hours total (workshops + simulations). Your team's time is minimized.

### Concern: "What if you shut down or get acquired?"
**Answer**: Fair question. We're raising funding now, but even if we fail, you've gained: crisis playbooks, trained team, improved readiness. Zero downside.

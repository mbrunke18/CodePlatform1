# SLIDE 1: The $18M Problem

## Your Last Strategic Crisis Probably Looked Like This:

**Hour 1**: Something breaks  
- Security breach discovered  
- Product recall needed  
- Executive scandal breaks  
- Major competitor move  
- Regulatory change announced

**Hours 2-24**: Email Chaos  
- 100+ emails flying between Legal, PR, Executives  
- "Who's handling what?"  
- "Has anyone called the board?"  
- Duplicate work, missed tasks, confusion

**Hours 25-72**: Slow Coordination  
- Emergency meetings scheduled (calendars conflict)  
- War rooms assembled (people missing)  
- Tasks assigned (Slack, email, text - scattered)  
- Decisions delayed (can't find who approved what)

**Cost**: $18M in market cap, damaged reputation, executive stress

# SLIDE 6: Why Start with Crisis Management?

## The Perfect First Implementation

### ✅ Proves the Entire Platform
- **Monitoring**: AI detects crisis signals  
- **Coordination**: Auto-assembles war room  
- **Execution**: Tasks, communications, decisions  
- **Learning**: Captures outcomes for next time  

**Translation**: If it works for crisis (highest pressure), it works for everything.

### ✅ Universal Pain Point
- Every Fortune 1000 faces 3-5 crises per year  
- Crisis = highest stakes, most visible failures  
- Board-level accountability

### ✅ Fast Time-to-Value
- 90-day pilot proves complete value  
- No waiting for "the next crisis" - we simulate it  
- Tabletop exercises validate readiness

### ✅ Clear Expansion Path
- **Month 1-3**: Master crisis coordination  
- **Month 4-6**: Add your #2 scenario (product launch? compliance?)  
- **Month 7-12**: Expand to full platform across all strategic decisions

**This isn't a crisis tool. It's an executive operations platform. Crisis is just how we prove it works.**

---

# SLIDE 7: Demo: Crisis Response (First Use Case)

## Example: Data Breach Response

### Traditional Approach (72 hours)
- **Discovery**: IT finds breach at 2am Friday  
- **Hour 0-12**: IT tries to reach CISO (weekend), sends emails  
- **Hour 12-24**: CISO reaches CEO, starts calling Legal  
- **Hour 24-48**: Saturday war room scheduled, 50% attendance  
- **Hour 48-72**: Monday follow-up, customer notification delayed  
- **Damage**: Breach reported in press before official statement

### Bastion Approach (4 hours)
- **Minute 1**: AI alerts CISO (anomaly detected)  
- **Minute 5**: War room auto-created (CISO, CEO, Legal, PR, IT)  
- **Minute 30**: Playbook activated (17 tasks assigned)  
- **Hour 2**: Legal review complete, communication approved  
- **Hour 4**: Customer notification sent, press release issued  
- **Result**: Controlled narrative, trust maintained

**Same Platform For**:  
- Product recalls  
- Competitive responses  
- M&A announcements  
- Regulatory changes  
- Executive transitions

# SLIDE 15: Competitive Landscape

## Why This Category Doesn't Exist Yet

### Current "Solutions" (Fragmented)
❌ **Email + Slack + Meetings**: No structure, lost context, manual coordination  
❌ **Project Management** (Asana, Monday): Tactical tasks, not strategic execution  
❌ **Enterprise Platforms** (Salesforce, ServiceNow): Built for different workflows (sales, IT tickets)  
❌ **Consulting Firms**: Expensive, not software, no ongoing monitoring  
❌ **Corporate Strategy Teams**: Manual coordination, no automation, no AI

### What Exists for OTHER Functions
✅ **Sales**: Salesforce (CRM - track every deal)  
✅ **Marketing**: HubSpot (Marketing ops - track every campaign)  
✅ **Engineering**: Jira (Dev ops - track every sprint)  
✅ **IT Operations**: ServiceNow (Track every incident)  

### What's MISSING for Executives
❌ **Strategic Operations**: NO PLATFORM for executives to coordinate high-stakes decisions

**That's Bastion. Executive Decision Operations.**

### Why Now?
- **AI Maturity**: GPT-4o enables real-time analysis and coordination  
- **Digital Transformation**: Remote work demands better coordination tools  
- **Decision Velocity**: Competitive advantage = execution speed  
- **Category Timing**: First mover defines the category

---

# SLIDE 16: Investment & Business Model

## How This Becomes a Business

### Pilot Phase (Now - Q1 2026)
- **Design Partners**: 3 companies (including you)  
- **Price**: $0 (free access for 90 days)  
- **Goal**: Prove platform value, capture references, define category

### Commercialization (Q2 2026)
- **Tier 1**: $50K/year (1-5,000 employees, 3 scenarios)  
- **Tier 2**: $150K/year (5,001-25,000 employees, 7 scenarios)  
- **Tier 3**: $300K/year (25,000+ employees, all 13+ scenarios)  
- **Includes**: Unlimited users, AI monitoring, integrations, support

### Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026)

- **Enterprise**: $500K+ for Fortune 100 with dedicated support  
- **Platform Extensions**: Custom integrations, advanced analytics

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: 500 Fortune 1000 companies × $300K/year = **$150M ARR potential**  
- **Initial Segment**: 100 companies × $200K average = $20M serviceable market  
- **Launch Target**: 10-15 paying customers by end of 2026 = $2M ARR  
- **Series A Valuation**: $2M ARR × 15x multiple = $30M valuation

### Category Definition
- **We're not selling features. We're creating a category.**  
- Like Salesforce didn't sell "contact management" - they sold "CRM"

# SLIDE 18: Risk Mitigation

## Your Concerns (And Our Answers)

### Concern: "Why start with crisis if this is a full platform?"
**Answer**: Crisis = highest pressure, best proof. If it works for crisis (minutes matter), it works for everything. Plus, you immediately get value while we expand to other scenarios.

### Concern: "What if no crisis happens during the pilot?"
**Answer**: We simulate crises (tabletop exercises). You don't need a real crisis to prove platform value. Preparedness is the goal.

### Concern: "This sounds too broad - can you really do 13 scenarios?"
**Answer**: Yes. The platform is the same (prepare → monitor → execute → learn). Only the playbooks differ. We start with ONE (crisis), prove it, then expand to your priorities.

### Concern: "We already have tools for different scenarios."
**Answer**: Exactly the problem. Email for crisis, Asana for projects, consultants for M&A - all fragmented. We orchestrate what you already do, across ALL scenarios, in one platform.

### Concern: "What makes this an 'operations platform' vs. just software?"
**Answer**: Same way Salesforce is "CRM" not "contact database" - we're creating a category for executive-level coordination, not just automating tasks.

### Concern: "We're too busy for a 90-day pilot."
**Answer**: We do the heavy lifting (40 hours of our time). Your investment: 4-6 hours total (workshops + simulations). Your team's time is minimized. ROI is immediate.

# SLIDE 6: Why Start with Crisis Management?

## The Perfect First Implementation

### ✅ Proves the Entire Platform
- **Monitoring**: AI detects crisis signals  
- **Coordination**: Auto-assembles war room  
- **Execution**: Tasks, communications, decisions  
- **Learning**: Captures outcomes for next time  

**Translation**: If it works for crisis (highest pressure), it works for everything.

### ✅ Universal Pain Point
- Every Fortune 1000 faces 3-5 crises per year  
- Crisis = highest stakes, most visible failures  
- Board-level accountability

### ✅ Fast Time-to-Value
- 90-day pilot proves complete value  
- No waiting for "the next crisis" - we simulate it  
- Tabletop exercises validate readiness

### ✅ Clear Expansion Path
- **Month 1-3**: Master crisis coordination  
- **Month 4-6**: Add your #2 scenario (product launch? compliance?)  
- **Month 7-12**: Expand to full platform across all strategic decisions

**This isn't a crisis tool. It's an executive operations platform. Crisis is just how we prove it works.**

# SLIDE 7: Demo: Crisis Response (First Use Case)

## Example: Data Breach Response

### Traditional Approach (72 hours)
- **Discovery**: IT finds breach at 2am Friday  
- **Hour 0-12**: IT tries to reach CISO (weekend), sends emails  
- **Hour 12-24**: CISO reaches CEO, starts calling Legal  
- **Hour 24-48**: Saturday war room scheduled, 50% attendance  
- **Hour 48-72**: Monday follow-up, customer notification delayed  
- **Damage**: Breach reported in press before official statement

### Bastion Approach (4 hours)
- **Minute 1**: AI alerts CISO (anomaly detected)  
- **Minute 5**: War room auto-created (CISO, CEO, Legal, PR, IT)  
- **Minute 30**: Playbook activated (17 tasks assigned)  
- **Hour 2**: Legal review complete, communication approved  
- **Hour 4**: Customer notification sent, press release issued  
- **Result**: Controlled narrative, trust maintained

**Same Platform For**:  
- Product recalls  
- Competitive responses  
- M&A announcements  
- Regulatory changes  
- Executive transitions

# SLIDE 15: Competitive Landscape

## Why This Category Doesn't Exist Yet

### Current "Solutions" (Fragmented)
❌ **Email + Slack + Meetings**: No structure, lost context, manual coordination  
❌ **Project Management** (Asana, Monday): Tactical tasks, not strategic execution  
❌ **Enterprise Platforms** (Salesforce, ServiceNow): Built for different workflows (sales, IT tickets)  
❌ **Consulting Firms**: Expensive, not software, no ongoing monitoring  
❌ **Corporate Strategy Teams**: Manual coordination, no automation, no AI

### What Exists for OTHER Functions
✅ **Sales**: Salesforce (CRM - track every deal)  
✅ **Marketing**: HubSpot (Marketing ops - track every campaign)  
✅ **Engineering**: Jira (Dev ops - track every sprint)  
✅ **IT Operations**: ServiceNow (Track every incident)  

### What's MISSING for Executives
❌ **Strategic Operations**: NO PLATFORM for executives to coordinate high-stakes decisions

**That's Bastion. Executive Decision Operations.**

### Why Now?
- **AI Maturity**: GPT-4o enables real-time analysis and coordination  
- **Digital Transformation**: Remote work demands better coordination tools  
- **Decision Velocity**: Competitive advantage = execution speed  
- **Category Timing**: First mover defines the category

---

# SLIDE 16: Investment & Business Model

## How This Becomes a Business

### Pilot Phase (Now - Q1 2026)
- **Design Partners**: 3 companies (including you)  
- **Price**: $0 (free access for 90 days)  
- **Goal**: Prove platform value, capture references, define category

### Commercialization (Q2 2026)
- **Tier 1**: $50K/year (1-5,000 employees, 3 scenarios)  
- **Tier 2**: $150K/year (5,001-25,000 employees, 7 scenarios)  
- **Tier 3**: $300K/year (25,000+ employees, all 13+ scenarios)  
- **Includes**: Unlimited users, AI monitoring, integrations, support

### Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026)

- **Enterprise**: $500K+ for Fortune 100 with dedicated support  
- **Platform Extensions**: Custom integrations, advanced analytics

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: 500 Fortune 1000 companies × $300K/year = **$150M ARR potential**  
- **Initial Segment**: 100 companies × $200K average = $20M serviceable market  
- **Launch Target**: 10-15 paying customers by end of 2026 = $2M ARR  
- **Series A Valuation**: $2M ARR × 15x multiple = $30M valuation

### Category Definition
- **We're not selling features. We're creating a category.**  
- Like Salesforce didn't sell "contact management" - they sold "CRM"

# SLIDE 18: Risk Mitigation

## Your Concerns (And Our Answers)

### Concern: "Why start with crisis if this is a full platform?"
**Answer**: Crisis = highest pressure, best proof. If it works for crisis (minutes matter), it works for everything. Plus, you immediately get value while we expand to other scenarios.

### Concern: "What if no crisis happens during the pilot?"
**Answer**: We simulate crises (tabletop exercises). You don't need a real crisis to prove platform value. Preparedness is the goal.

### Concern: "This sounds too broad - can you really do 13 scenarios?"
**Answer**: Yes. The platform is the same (prepare → monitor → execute → learn). Only the playbooks differ. We start with ONE (crisis), prove it, then expand to your priorities.

### Concern: "We already have tools for different scenarios."
**Answer**: Exactly the problem. Email for crisis, Asana for projects, consultants for M&A - all fragmented. We orchestrate what you already do, across ALL scenarios, in one platform.

### Concern: "What makes this an 'operations platform' vs. just software?"
**Answer**: Same way Salesforce is "CRM" not "contact database" - we're creating a category for executive-level coordination, not just automating tasks.

### Concern: "We're too busy for a 90-day pilot."
**Answer**: We do the heavy lifting (40 hours of our time). Your investment: 4-6 hours total (workshops + simulations). Your team's time is minimized. ROI is immediate.

# SLIDE 1: The $18M Problem

**Hour 1**: Something breaks  
- Security breach discovered  
- Product recall needed

# SLIDE 15: Competitive Landscape

## Why This Category Doesn't Exist Yet

### Current "Solutions" (Fragmented)
❌ **Email + Slack + Meetings**: No structure, lost context, manual coordination  
❌ **Project Management** (Asana, Monday): Tactical tasks, not strategic execution  
❌ **Enterprise Platforms** (Salesforce, ServiceNow): Built for different workflows (sales, IT tickets)  
❌ **Consulting Firms**: Expensive, not software, no ongoing monitoring  
❌ **Corporate Strategy Teams**: Manual coordination, no automation, no AI

### What Exists for OTHER Functions
✅ **Sales**: Salesforce (CRM - track every deal)  
✅ **Marketing**: HubSpot (Marketing ops - track every campaign)  
✅ **Engineering**: Jira (Dev ops - track every sprint)  
✅ **IT Operations**: ServiceNow (Track every incident)  

### What's MISSING for Executives
❌ **Strategic Operations**: NO PLATFORM for executives to coordinate high-stakes decisions

**That's Bastion. Executive Decision Operations.**

### Why Now?
- **AI Maturity**: GPT-4o enables real-time analysis and coordination  
- **Digital Transformation**: Remote work demands better coordination tools  
- **Decision Velocity**: Competitive advantage = execution speed  
- **Category Timing**: First mover defines the category

---

# SLIDE 16: Investment & Business Model

## How This Becomes a Business

### Pilot Phase (Now - Q1 2026)
- **Design Partners**: 3 companies (including you)  
- **Price**: $0 (free access for 90 days)  
- **Goal**: Prove platform value, capture references, define category

### Commercialization (Q2 2026)
- **Tier 1**: $50K/year (1-5,000 employees, 3 scenarios)  
- **Tier 2**: $150K/year (5,001-25,000 employees, 7 scenarios)  
- **Tier 3**: $300K/year (25,000+ employees, all 13+ scenarios)  
- **Includes**: Unlimited users, AI monitoring, integrations, support

### Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026)
- **Add-On Scenarios**: $25K/year per additional scenario type  
- **Professional Services**: $200/hour for custom playbooks  
- **Enterprise**: $500K+ for Fortune 100 with dedicated support  
- **Platform Extensions**: Custom integrations, advanced analytics

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: 500 Fortune 1000 companies × $300K/year = **$150M ARR potential**  
- **Initial Segment**: 100 companies × $200K average = $20M serviceable market  
- **Launch Target**: 10-15 paying customers by end of 2026 = $2M ARR  
- **Series A Valuation**: $2M ARR × 15x multiple = $30M valuation

### Category Definition
- **We're not selling features. We're creating a category.**  
- Like Salesforce didn't sell "contact management" - they sold "CRM"  
- We're not selling "crisis tools" - we're selling "Executive Decision Operations"

# SLIDE 18: Risk Mitigation

## Your Concerns (And Our Answers)

### Concern: "Why start with crisis if this is a full platform?"
**Answer**: Crisis = highest pressure, best proof. If it works for crisis (minutes matter), it works for everything. Plus, you immediately get value while we expand to other scenarios.

### Concern: "What if no crisis happens during the pilot?"
**Answer**: We simulate crises (tabletop exercises). You don't need a real crisis to prove platform value. Preparedness is the goal.

### Concern: "This sounds too broad - can you really do 13 scenarios?"
**Answer**: Yes. The platform is the same (prepare → monitor → execute → learn). Only the playbooks differ. We start with ONE (crisis), prove it, then expand to your priorities.

### Concern: "We already have tools for different scenarios."
**Answer**: Exactly the problem. Email for crisis, Asana for projects, consultants for M&A - all fragmented. We orchestrate what you already do, across ALL scenarios, in one platform.

### Concern: "What makes this an 'operations platform' vs. just software?"
**Answer**: Same way Salesforce is "CRM" not "contact database" - we're creating a category for executive-level coordination, not just automating tasks.

### Concern: "We're too busy for a 90-day pilot."
**Answer**: We do the heavy lifting (40 hours of our time). Your investment: 4-6 hours total (workshops + simulations). Your team's time is minimized. ROI is immediate.

# SLIDE 1: The $18M Problem

**Hours 25-72**: Slow Coordination  
- Emergency meetings scheduled (calendars conflict)  
- War rooms assembled (people missing)  
- Tasks assigned (Slack, email, text - scattered)

# SLIDE 7: Demo: Crisis Response (First Use Case)

## Example: Data Breach Response

### Traditional Approach (72 hours)
- **Discovery**: IT finds breach at 2am Friday  
- **Hour 0-12**: IT tries to reach CISO (weekend), sends emails  
- **Hour 12-24**: CISO reaches CEO, starts calling Legal  
- **Hour 24-48**: Saturday war room scheduled, 50% attendance  
- **Hour 48-72**: Monday follow-up, customer notification delayed  
- **Damage**: Breach reported in press before official statement

### Bastion Approach (4 hours)
- **Minute 1**: AI alerts CISO (anomaly detected)  
- **Minute 5**: War room auto-created (CISO, CEO, Legal, PR, IT)  
- **Minute 30**: Playbook activated (17 tasks assigned)  
- **Hour 2**: Legal review complete, communication approved  
- **Hour 4**: Customer notification sent, press release issued  
- **Result**: Controlled narrative, trust maintained

# SLIDE 15: Competitive Landscape

## Why This Category Doesn't Exist Yet

### Current "Solutions" (Fragmented)
❌ **Email + Slack + Meetings**: No structure, lost context, manual coordination  
❌ **Project Management** (Asana, Monday): Tactical tasks, not strategic execution  
❌ **Enterprise Platforms** (Salesforce, ServiceNow): Built for different workflows (sales, IT tickets)  
❌ **Consulting Firms**: Expensive, not software, no ongoing monitoring  
❌ **Corporate Strategy Teams**: Manual coordination, no automation, no AI

### What Exists for OTHER Functions
✅ **Sales**: Salesforce (CRM - track every deal)  
✅ **Marketing**: HubSpot (Marketing ops - track every campaign)  
✅ **Engineering**: Jira (Dev ops - track every sprint)  
✅ **IT Operations**: ServiceNow (Track every incident)  

### What's MISSING for Executives
❌ **Strategic Operations**: NO PLATFORM for executives to coordinate high-stakes decisions

**That's Bastion. Executive Decision Operations.**

### Why Now?
- **AI Maturity**: GPT-4o enables real-time analysis and coordination  
- **Digital Transformation**: Remote work demands better coordination tools  
- **Decision Velocity**: Competitive advantage = execution speed  
- **Category Timing**: First mover defines the category

# SLIDE 16: Investment & Business Model

## How This Becomes a Business

### Pilot Phase (Now - Q1 2026)
- **Design Partners**: 3 companies (including you)  
- **Price**: $0 (free access for 90 days)  
- **Goal**: Prove platform value, capture references, define category

### Commercialization (Q2 2026)
- **Tier 1**: $50K/year (1-5,000 employees, 3 scenarios)  
- **Tier 2**: $150K/year (5,001-25,000 employees, 7 scenarios)  
- **Tier 3**: $300K/year (25,000+ employees, all 13+ scenarios)  
- **Includes**: Unlimited users, AI monitoring, integrations, support

### Expansion (Q3-Q4 2026)
- **Add-On Scenarios**: $25K/year per additional scenario type  
- **Professional Services**: $200/hour for custom playbooks  
- **Enterprise**: $500K+ for Fortune 100 with dedicated support  
- **Platform Extensions**: Custom integrations, advanced analytics

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: 500 Fortune 1000 companies × $300K/year = **$150M ARR potential**  
- **Initial Segment**: 100 companies × $200K average = $20M serviceable market  
- **Launch Target**: 10-15 paying customers by end of 2026 = $2M ARR  
- **Series A Valuation**: $2M ARR × 15x multiple = $30M valuation

### Category Definition
- **We're not selling features. We're creating a category.**  
- Like Salesforce didn't sell "contact management" - they sold "CRM"  
- We're not selling "crisis tools" - we're selling "Executive Decision Operations"

# SLIDE 18: Risk Mitigation

## Your Concerns (And Our Answers)

### Concern: "Why start with crisis if this is a full platform?"
**Answer**: Crisis = highest pressure, best proof. If it works for crisis (minutes matter), it works for everything. Plus, you immediately get value while we expand to other scenarios.

### Concern: "What if no crisis happens during the pilot?"
**Answer**: We simulate crises (tabletop exercises). You don't need a real crisis to prove platform value. Preparedness is the goal.

### Concern: "This sounds too broad - can you really do 13 scenarios?"
**Answer**: Yes. The platform is the same (prepare → monitor → execute → learn). Only the playbooks differ. We start with ONE (crisis), prove it, then expand to your priorities.

### Concern: "We already have tools for different scenarios."
**Answer**: Exactly the problem. Email for crisis, Asana for projects, consultants for M&A - all fragmented. We orchestrate what you already do, across ALL scenarios, in one platform.

### Concern: "What makes this an 'operations platform' vs. just software?"
**Answer**: Same way Salesforce is "CRM" not "contact database" - we're creating a category for executive-level coordination, not just automating tasks.

### Concern: "We're too busy for a 90-day pilot."
**Answer**: We do the heavy lifting (40 hours of our time). Your investment: 4-6 hours total (workshops + simulations). Your team's time is minimized. ROI is immediate.

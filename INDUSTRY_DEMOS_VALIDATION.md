## 📈 ELEVATOR PITCHES (From Document)

### To JPMorgan Chase (Financial)
*"Your AI systems can detect a cyberattack in milliseconds, algorithmic bias in seconds, and liquidity crises in minutes. But coordinating your CEO, CISO, CFO, General Counsel, Board, and regulators still takes 48-72 hours of email chains and emergency meetings. In that window, a $1M incident becomes a $27M disaster."*

### To Pfizer (Pharmaceutical)
*"Your quality control AI detected the Glenmark dissolution defect immediately. But the recall coordination took weeks, and a patient died in that gap. Not from the science failing—from the coordination failing."*

### To Toyota (Manufacturing)
*"Toyota pioneered Just-In-Time manufacturing—zero inventory, maximum efficiency. But you're still running Just-In-Case crisis management—hoping email chains work fast enough."*

### To Walmart (Retail)
*"Your AI already saved you $20 million in transportation costs. But when salmonella was detected in your lettuce, how long did it take to coordinate removal from 847 stores, notify 12,847 customers, and file FDA reports? Days? A week?"*

### To NextEra Energy (Energy/Utilities)
*"Your SCADA systems detected the grid cascade in real-time. Your AI predicted the equipment failure hours in advance. But when the crisis hit, how long did it take to coordinate your CEO, the Governor's office, FERC, DHS, your Board, and 200 field personnel?"*

### To Salesforce (Technology/SaaS)
*"Salesforce, you power the operations of 150,000 companies. When your platform goes down, those 150,000 companies go dark. Your monitoring systems detect outages in milliseconds. But how long does it take to coordinate your CEO, CTO, incident commander, 50 engineers, customer support, communications, and 150,000 customer notifications?"*

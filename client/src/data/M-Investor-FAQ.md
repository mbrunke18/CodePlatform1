## THE PRODUCT

### 1. What exactly does M do?

M is a Strategic Execution Operating System that cuts enterprise response time from 72 hours to 12 minutes. When a strategic event happens—competitor move, crisis, M&A opportunity, regulatory change—M automatically activates pre-staged playbooks and coordinates response across all stakeholders simultaneously.

**The elevator pitch:** "We give Fortune 1000 executives the same coordination advantage that NFL coaches have. When the trigger fires, everyone knows their play and executes immediately."

---

### 2. How is this different from project management tools like Asana or Monday?

Project management tools track work after someone decides what to do. M handles the 72 hours *before* that—the signal detection, playbook selection, stakeholder notification, and coordinated launch.

| Asana/Monday | M |
|--------------|---|
| Tracks tasks after creation | Creates tasks automatically when triggers fire |
| Reactive | Proactive (pre-staged playbooks) |
| Generic workflows | 166 strategic playbooks across 9 domains |
| Individual productivity | Enterprise-wide coordination |
| $10-30/user/month | $250K-$1.5M enterprise contracts |

Different buyer (CSO vs. team leads), different budget (strategic vs. operational), different outcome (coordination speed vs. task completion).

---

### 3. How is this different from ServiceNow or Salesforce?

ServiceNow automates IT workflows. Salesforce manages customer relationships. M coordinates strategic execution across the C-suite.

**ServiceNow:** "Your laptop is broken → ticket created → IT fixes it"  
**Salesforce:** "Lead comes in → sales process → deal closes"  
**M:** "Competitor launches product → playbook activates → CFO, CMO, CPO, Legal all receive coordinated tasks → response launches in 12 minutes"

These tools might be *downstream* of M—M can push tasks into ServiceNow or Salesforce—but they can't replace the strategic coordination layer.

---

### 4. What are the 166 playbooks?

Pre-built response templates across 9 strategic domains:

| Domain | Example Playbooks |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Crisis Management** | Ransomware response, product recall, executive misconduct |
| **Competitive Response** | Competitor product launch, pricing war, market entry defense |
| **M&A Execution** | Due diligence coordination, Day 1 integration, synergy capture |
| **Market Expansion** | New market entry, channel launch, geographic expansion |
| **Product Launch** | Go-to-market coordination, analyst briefing, customer migration |
| **Regulatory Response** | Compliance deadline, audit preparation, policy change |
| **Operational Disruption** | Supply chain failure, key vendor loss, facility incident |
| **Talent & Organization** | Executive transition, RIF coordination, restructuring |
| **AI Governance** | AI ethics compliance, model governance, algorithmic risk management |

Each playbook includes: trigger conditions, stakeholder assignments, decision trees, communication templates, escalation paths, and success metrics.

---

### 5. How does the "12 minutes" claim work?

The 12 minutes is time-to-first-coordinated-action, not time-to-resolution. Here's the breakdown:

| Phase | Without M | With M |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Signal detection | 4-24 hours | Real-time (AI monitoring) |
| Leadership notification | 2-8 hours | Instant (automated alerts) |
| Stakeholder assembly | 4-24 hours | Pre-assigned in playbook |
| Response planning | 8-24 hours | Pre-staged (playbook activation) |
| Task assignment | 2-4 hours | Automatic (one-click deployment) |
| **Total to first action** | **24-72 hours** | **~12 minutes** |

We're not claiming the *crisis is resolved* in 12 minutes—we're claiming the *coordinated response is launched* in 12 minutes. The rest of the execution follows the playbook.

---

### 6. What integrations does M support?

Current integration architecture supports:

- **Communication:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email
- **Project Management:** Jira, Asana, Monday, ServiceNow
- **Documents:** Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, SharePoint
- **Data:** Snowflake, custom APIs
- **Identity:** SSO (Okta, Azure AD)

M is designed as a coordination layer that pushes tasks into existing tools—we don't ask customers to replace their stack.

---

## THE MARKET

### 7. What's the market size?

**Adjacent markets (validated):**
- Enterprise Risk Management: $15B
- Business Continuity Software: $825M
- Strategic Planning Software: $2.1B
- Crisis Management Software: $12B (projected 2030)

**Our thesis:** These are fragmented solutions to one problem—strategic execution speed. M creates a new category: Strategic Execution Operating Systems (SEOS).

**Bottom-up TAM:** 5,000 Global 2000 companies × $500K average contract = $2.5B addressable market for the platform alone.

---

### 8. Why hasn't someone built this before?

Three things had to converge:

1. **AI capability:** Real-time signal analysis across unstructured data sources (news, social, filings) wasn't possible until LLMs matured in 2023-2024.

2. **Enterprise cloud adoption:** Companies now have the integration infrastructure (APIs, SSO, cloud tools) to deploy a coordination layer across departments.

3. **Executive awareness:** Post-COVID, leaders understand that "black swan" events aren't rare. PwC 2023: 91% of organizations faced major disruption in the past 2 years.

The market is ready now in a way it wasn't 5 years ago.

---

### 9. Who is the buyer?

**Primary:** Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer

**Secondary:** CEO (for largest deals), CFO (budget holder), Chief of Staff

**Not the buyer:** CIO/CTO (this isn't an IT purchase), PMO (too tactical)

M is sold top-down as a strategic capability, not bottom-up as a productivity tool.

---

### 10. What's your go-to-market strategy?

**Phase 1 (Now):** Direct enterprise sales to Fortune 500. 3-5 design partners at discounted pilot rates to validate and generate case studies.

**Phase 2 (Year 2):** Expand to Fortune 1000. Add industry-specific playbook packs. Build partner channel with Big 4 consultancies.

**Phase 3 (Year 3+):** Mid-market offering. Self-service onboarding. International expansion.

We're not trying to boil the ocean—we're starting with the largest, most sophisticated buyers who feel this pain acutely.

---

## THE BUSINESS

### 11. What's the pricing model?

| Tier | Annual Contract | Target Customer |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Foundation** | $250K | Fortune 1000, single domain |
| **Professional** | $500K | Fortune 500, multi-domain |
| **Enterprise** | $1M+ | Global 500, full platform |

Pricing is based on: number of playbook domains, number of active users, integration complexity, and support level.

**Unit economics target:** 80%+ gross margin (SaaS delivery), $150K+ ACV, 18-month payback.

---

### 12. What's your current traction?

We're pre-revenue, focused on product completion and design partner acquisition. Current status:

- **Product:** MVP complete, 84.4% system verification pass rate
- **Pipeline:** [X] qualified conversations with Fortune 500 prospects
- **Design Partners:** Targeting 3-5 pilots launching Q1 2025
- **Team:** [X] FTEs plus advisory network

We're raising to accelerate sales hiring and complete enterprise hardening.

---

### 13. What are you raising and what's the use of funds?

**Raising:** $2.6M Seed

**Use of funds:**
| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Engineering | 40% | Enterprise features, integrations, security |
| Sales & Marketing | 35% | 2 enterprise AEs, demand generation, content |
| Operations | 15% | Customer success, implementation support |
| G&A | 10% | Legal, finance, infrastructure |

**Runway:** 18 months to Series A milestones

---

### 14. What are your Series A milestones?

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| ARR | $2M+ |
| Customers | 5-8 enterprise logos |
| Net Revenue Retention | 120%+ |
| Sales Efficiency | >0.8 |

We believe 3-5 design partners converting to full contracts plus 3-5 net-new customers gets us there.

---

## THE COMPETITION

### 15. Who are your competitors?

**Direct competitors:** None building SEOS specifically. The category doesn't exist yet.

**Adjacent players:**

| Company | What They Do | Why They're Not M |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Fusion Risk Management** | Business continuity planning | Compliance-focused, not execution speed |
| **Everbridge** | Mass notification | Single channel (alerts), not coordination |
| **OnSolve** | Crisis communication | Communication only, no playbook orchestration |
| **Asana/Monday** | Project management | Task tracking, not strategic coordination |
| **ServiceNow** | IT workflow automation | IT-centric, not C-suite strategic |

**The real competitor:** Status quo. Excel spreadsheets, email chains, and 72-hour response times.

---

### 16. Why can't Salesforce/Microsoft/ServiceNow just build this?

They could build *features*—but they can't build the *system*.

1. **Domain expertise:** Our 166 playbooks represent 20+ years of Fortune 500 strategic execution experience. A feature team at Salesforce doesn't have this knowledge.

2. **Buyer mismatch:** Salesforce sells to CROs. ServiceNow sells to CIOs. M sells to CSOs and COOs. Different buyer, different requirements, different sales motion.

3. **Platform architecture:** M is designed as an orchestration layer *above* these tools. We push tasks into Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira. We're complementary, not competitive.

4. **Focus:** For Microsoft, this would be a rounding error. For us, it's everything. Startups win when they can out-focus incumbents.

---

### 17. What's your moat?

| Moat | Durability |
|------|------------|
| **166 pre-built playbooks** | 2+ years of domain expertise encoded. Competitors start from zero. |
| **Founder credibility** | Unique combination of Fortune 500 execution + coaching methodology. Authentic story. |
| **First-mover in category** | SEOS doesn't exist. We define it. |
| **Enterprise relationships** | Design partners become references. Network effects in enterprise sales. |
| **Data advantage** | Every execution improves playbooks. More customers = smarter platform. |

---

## THE TEAM & FOUNDER

### 18. Why are you the one to build this?

I've spent 20+ years watching Fortune 500 companies take 72 hours to make decisions that championship teams make in 40 seconds.

- **Enterprise experience:** Ford, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly, Boyd Gaming, Charles Schwab, Churchill Downs
- **Coaching methodology:** 5 years of collegiate football coaching, including bowl championship
- **Pattern recognition:** I've seen the same coordination failures across every industry. The playbook approach works—I've proven it on the field and in the boardroom.

This isn't a technical founder looking for a problem. This is a domain expert who's lived the problem and finally has the technology to solve it.

---

### 19. What's the team structure?

**Current:**
- Founder/CEO: Product vision, sales, fundraising
- [Technical resources]: Platform development
- Advisors: [Enterprise software veterans, industry experts]

**Post-raise hiring plan:**
- VP Engineering (Q1)
- 2 Enterprise Account Executives (Q1-Q2)
- Customer Success Lead (Q2)
- Solutions Engineer (Q2)

---

### 20. What's your unfair advantage?

The coaching methodology is the unfair advantage.

Every enterprise software company talks about "playbooks"—but they mean templates. We mean *actual plays*: pre-practiced, trigger-activated, role-assigned responses that execute automatically when the situation demands.

I've run this system on a football field with 80,000 fans watching. I've implemented it in Fortune 500 boardrooms. I know it works because I've *lived* it—on both sides.

That's not something a product manager at Salesforce can replicate in a sprint.

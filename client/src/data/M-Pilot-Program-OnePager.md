## Success Metrics

We measure pilot success on four dimensions:

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Response Time Reduction** | 80%+ faster | Time from signal to first coordinated action |
| **Playbook Activation Rate** | 90%+ | % of configured playbooks ready to deploy |
| **Stakeholder Adoption** | 85%+ | % of assigned users actively engaged |
| **Executive Satisfaction** | 4.5+/5 | Post-pilot survey scores |

**Primary success indicator:** At least one drill or live activation demonstrates response time under 15 minutes (vs. baseline typically 24-72 hours).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if we don't have a crisis during the pilot?**  
A: We conduct tabletop drills that simulate real scenarios. You'll see the response time improvement without needing an actual incident. If a real event does occur, even better—you'll have proof in production.

**Q: How much time commitment is required from our team?**  
A: Executive sponsor: 2-3 hours/month. Project lead: 5-8 hours/week. Stakeholders: 2-4 hours total for training plus drill participation.

**Q: What if we want to expand scope during the pilot?**  
A: Additional playbook domains can be added. We'll discuss pricing for expanded scope and credit it toward the full contract.

**Q: What happens to our data after the pilot?**  
A: If you don't continue, all data is exported to you and deleted from our systems within 30 days. Your playbooks and configurations are yours.

**Q: Can we do a shorter pilot?**  
A: We recommend 90 days to get meaningful results, but can discuss 60-day options for organizations with urgent timelines.

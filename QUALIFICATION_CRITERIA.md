# VEXOR Early Access Program
## Partner Qualification Criteria

**Program:** Q1 2025 Pilot Partnership  
**Target Partners:** 10 Fortune 1000 Companies  
**Document Version:** 1.0 (October 2025)

---

## Overview

VEXOR's Early Access Program seeks **mission-critical validation partners** who will rigorously test the Executive Decision Operations Platform in real strategic scenarios. This document outlines qualification criteria to ensure mutual success.

**Selection Philosophy:** We prioritize strategic fit, executive commitment, and implementation readiness over company size or brand prestige. The best partners have compelling use cases, organizational readiness, and authentic interest in transforming strategic execution.

---

## Required Qualifications

### 1. Organization Size & Maturity

**Minimum Requirements:**
- ✅ Fortune 1000 company OR equivalent ($500M+ annual revenue)
- ✅ Complex organizational structure (multi-department coordination needs)
- ✅ Established enterprise technology infrastructure

**Why This Matters:**
VEXOR is designed for enterprise-scale strategic execution. Smaller organizations may not face the coordination complexity that creates ROI, while mature enterprises have the infrastructure to integrate and the use cases to validate.

**Evaluation Questions:**
- What is your annual revenue?
- How many business units/divisions require strategic coordination?
- What enterprise systems are already in use (CRM, project management, communication platforms)?

---

### 2. Strategic Execution Challenges

**Minimum Requirements (Must Have At Least 2):**

✅ **Coordination Delays:**
- Strategic decisions take 48+ hours to coordinate across stakeholders
- Missed market opportunities due to slow response time
- Crisis response hampered by fragmented communication

✅ **Reactive Posture:**
- Lack of pre-built playbooks for anticipated scenarios
- Ad-hoc planning for recurring strategic situations
- Limited "What-If" scenario preparation

✅ **Institutional Memory Gaps:**
- Strategic decisions not systematically captured
- Repeated mistakes in similar scenarios
- Knowledge loss when key executives transition

✅ **Stakeholder Misalignment:**
- Difficulty coordinating cross-functional teams
- Unclear roles/responsibilities in strategic execution
- Conflicting priorities across business units

✅ **Opportunity Windows:**
- M&A targets identified but slow to execute
- Competitive threats requiring rapid response
- Market shifts demanding strategic pivots

**Why This Matters:**
VEXOR solves specific execution velocity problems. Without these pain points, ROI is difficult to demonstrate during validation.

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Describe your last strategic crisis. How long did coordination take?
- How many strategic opportunities have you missed due to execution delays?
- What recurring strategic scenarios do you face without ready-to-execute playbooks?

---

### 3. Executive Sponsorship

**Minimum Requirements:**

✅ **Sponsor Level:**
- C-suite (CEO, COO, CFO, CTO, Chief Strategy Officer) OR
- VP-level with strategic execution authority

✅ **Sponsor Commitment:**
- Active participation in program (2-3 hours/week)
- Decision authority for platform adoption
- Willingness to champion internally

✅ **Strategic Alignment:**
- Executive sponsor personally affected by coordination challenges
- Strategic execution is a top-3 organizational priority
- Sponsor committed to 90-day validation timeline

**Why This Matters:**
Without executive sponsorship, pilots fail due to:
- Lack of organizational prioritization
- Insufficient stakeholder buy-in
- Inability to secure resources (team time, integration access)
- No decision authority for post-validation expansion

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Who is your executive sponsor? What is their role?
- Why is strategic execution velocity a personal priority for this executive?
- What authority does the sponsor have to make platform adoption decisions?

---

### 4. Use Case Clarity

**Minimum Requirements:**

✅ **Defined Scenarios (3-5):**
- Specific strategic situations ready to operationalize
- Clear trigger conditions (what initiates the scenario)
- Identified stakeholders (who needs to coordinate)
- Measurable outcomes (what success looks like)

✅ **Scenario Mix:**
At least one scenario from each category:
- **Protection:** Crisis response, threat mitigation, regulatory compliance
- **Growth:** Market opportunities, M&A, partnerships, product launches
- **Transformation:** Strategic pivots, restructuring, cultural change

✅ **Frequency/Urgency:**
- Scenarios occur regularly (quarterly or more often) OR
- High-stakes scenarios where preparation is mission-critical

**Why This Matters:**
Vague use cases ("we want to be more agile") don't validate platform value. Specific scenarios enable:
- Concrete playbook development
- Clear before/after performance measurement
- Authentic ROI calculation

**Strong Use Case Examples:**

**Protection Scenario: Supplier Disruption Response**
- **Trigger:** Major supplier announces bankruptcy/production halt
- **Stakeholders:** Procurement, Operations, Finance, Legal, Communications
- **Current State:** 3-5 days to coordinate response, causing production delays
- **Target State:** 12-minute coordinated action plan with supplier alternatives activated

**Growth Scenario: M&A Opportunity Capture**
- **Trigger:** Target company becomes available for acquisition
- **Stakeholders:** Corporate Development, Finance, Legal, Integration Team
- **Current State:** 2-3 weeks from identification to offer, often losing to faster bidders
- **Target State:** 48-hour coordinated evaluation and offer execution

**Transformation Scenario: Market Pivot Execution**
- **Trigger:** Major competitor launches disruptive product
- **Stakeholders:** Strategy, Product, Marketing, Sales, Operations
- **Current State:** 4-6 weeks to align on response strategy
- **Target State:** 1-week coordinated counter-strategy with cross-functional execution plan

**Evaluation Questions:**
- What are your top 3-5 strategic scenarios for the pilot?
- What triggers these scenarios?
- Who needs to coordinate when they occur?
- How do you currently respond, and how long does it take?

✅ **Team Availability:**
- Program Champion identified (Director/Senior Manager level)
- Core pilot team allocated (3-5 people, 4-6 hours/week each)

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Who will lead the pilot day-to-day? (Program Champion)
- Can you allocate 3-5 core team members for playbook development?
- Do you have API access to Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and your CRM?
- When is your ideal kickoff timeline?

## 📋 How to Demo (3 Approaches)

### **Approach 1: Category-First (Mixed C-Suite)**
**Time: 10-12 minutes**
1. Show 3 categories (Offensive/Defensive/Special Teams)
2. Pick ONE scenario for full 7-phase walkthrough
3. Emphasize "same pattern, every situation"

**Best for:** Board presentations, multi-stakeholder demos

### **Approach 2: Persona-Specific (Single Role)**
**Time: 8-10 minutes**
1. Go straight to their relevant scenario:
   - **CEO**: M&A Integration or Strategic Partnership
   - **COO**: Supply Chain Disruption or Product Launch
   - **CHRO**: Culture Transformation or Talent Acquisition
   - **CFO**: Cost Reduction or Regulatory Compliance
   - **CTO/CIO**: Digital Transformation or Tech Migration
2. Full 7-phase walkthrough showing role-specific value
3. Connect to their current pain points

**Best for:** One-on-one executive meetings, role-specific pitches

### **Approach 3: Lightning Round (Time-Constrained)**
**Time: 5-6 minutes**
1. Show 3 scenarios - Phase 1 (Situation) & Phase 7 (Results) only
2. Reveal the pattern: "Same framework, every scenario"
3. Ask: "Which keeps you up at night?"

**Best for:** Elevator pitches, conference demos, first touchpoints

## 💡 Quick Demo Tips

### **DO:**
✅ Let executives pick their scenario (creates engagement)
✅ Show full 7-phase walkthrough for ONE scenario (depth > breadth)
✅ Connect to their specific pain point or recent crisis
✅ End with "Which scenario keeps you up at night?"
✅ Use concrete metrics (71 hours saved, $12M protected)

### **DON'T:**
❌ Rush through all 13 scenarios (overwhelming)
❌ Skip phases 2-6 (they need to see the full journey)
❌ Make it about "AI" (it's about executive decision velocity)
❌ Forget to ask which scenario resonates (qualification)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics to Track

After demos, measure:
1. **Scenario engagement**: Which scenarios get most clicks?
2. **Phase completion**: Do prospects finish all 7 phases?
3. **Time on page**: Are they studying or bouncing?
4. **Return visits**: Do they come back to review scenarios?
5. **Scenario-to-deal conversion**: Which scenarios close deals?

---

## 🎯 Next Steps for Prospects

**After demo, provide:**

1. **Access link**: Send `/business-scenarios` URL
2. **Top 2 scenarios**: Ask which are highest priority
3. **Playbook workshop**: Schedule 2-hour session to build first playbook
4. **Template library**: Grant access to 13+ starting templates
